                  face (I remember her making an entire room collapse once
                  by singing the folk song line "he stands at the corner, a
                  fag in his mouth..." without actually doing anything to
                  highlight the double-entendre). Or her retelling of the
                  time when she had started busking "Gold is the colour of
                  my true love's hair" just as, by total coincidence, a
                  woman with blue hair walked by (in her words: "...and I
                  thought...'nah'..."). And then there was the time in the
                  SCA when she was running for mayor of Ealdormere, and
                  walked up to me before the meeting and uttered the words
                  "If you'll vote for me, I'll make you city ratcatcher."

                  One of my favorite memories:<br />
                  <br />
                  It was Pennsic 19, at dusk. The torches were lit, the
                  campfires were burning about camp and above the buzz of
                  conversation and passing people on the way, I heard harp
                  music coming from up the hill. I stepped out of my
                  pavilion and made my way towards the music. And there she
                  was; seated outside Tammara and Richard's pavilion,
                  playing. I sat down. I listened. And I stayed until she
                  was finished, and then some.<br />
                  <br />
                  And that's how I want to remember her; in the torchlight,
                  with the smell of woodsmoke in the air and the muted
                  sounds of Pennsic in the background, playing her harp and
                  singing.</td>

                  mosquitoes, and consequently bats flitting about. As I
                  entered the grove, I saw this beautiful woman playing the
                  harp. She looked like a Boticelli Madonna,with her long
                  hair and gorgeous huge eyes. We never exchanged many
                  words over the years, but I felt a strong kinship with
                  her when I learned of her brain tumour (I had been Dx'd
                  with a brain tumour-fortunately a misdiagnosis-when I was
                  25)&gt; I continued to feel a kinship as my own illness
                  progresses. We miss the same things, walking, running,
                  dancing, riding a bike, playing an instrument&hellip;

                  Genevieve said something that I feel strongly too. I
                  didn't get to spend time with Menya on that many
                  occasions, if I count them up, but she did seem like a
                  much-loved sister to me. Also her sense of humour was
                  wonderful, and the grin to go with it.<br />
                  <br />
                  On one occasion we were chatting and Menya asked what my
                  middle name was, and I said I didn't have one. Menya
                  thought about it, and decided on a middle name she
                  thought would suit me. I'm not sure what spelling she had
                  in mind, but anyway, as of this week, I am Sharon
                  <i>Anne</i> Curtis.<br />
                  <br />
                  Menya, I'm going to miss you a lot. But at least anytime
                  I look at something with my full name on, I'll have a
                  reminder of you right there. Thank you.</td>

                  minds me posting here, as Menya and I didn't<br />
                  always get along, although I think we got over
                  that.<br />
                  <br />
                  Wendy Rose, John Carrott, and I are going to hold our own
                  little wake once Wendy is well again, and I still have a
                  tape of songs that Menya recorded for me about 7 or 8
                  years ago now. It's going to be really hard listening to
                  that knowing that she is now gone.<br />
                  <br />
                  While things didn't work out between us, there were
                  still<br />
                  some good times, and she did me a lot of good in
                  bringing<br />
                  me out of myself and showing me that someone could love
                  me.<br />
                  So for me Menya's greatest legacy is giving me
                  myself.<br />
                  <br />
                  Perhaps one of my favourite memories, though, is
                  canoeing<br />
                  in Algonquin Park. We almost left our tent on the
                  quayside.<br />
                  We saw the most amazing star filled sky I will ever
                  see.<br />
                  We cooked bannocks, saw loons, chipmunks, a
                  hummingbird,<br />
                  and met the maddest French people I will ever
                  encounter.<br />
                  That was a very special time.<br />
                  <br />
                  One of the other special times was helping out at
                  stuff<br />
                  during the Viking festival in York, and it is very
                  poignant<br />
                  that the height of the festival is this weekend.<br />
                  <br />
                  More than anything I am glad she found Pete. He<br />
                  has been such a rock, and frankly an inspiration to
                  the<br />
                  rest of us as well. He did more than I could ever
                  have<br />
                  done, so I am glad that Pete was there for her
                  through<br />
                  it all.</td>

                  sent home, albeit prematurely. A home care nurse was

                  By noon, I was fed up. The hospital way giving me the

                  <br />
                  I called Menya for help. Menya succinctly gave me the

                  <br />
                  Three women at a restaurant called the Living Well:
                  Heather tending bar, Kristine and Menya sitting on
                  barstools. They were having a conference about a _guy_,
                  who shall remain nameless not because I choose to be
                  circumspect but because I honestly can't remember his
                  name as it was so long ago.<br />
                  <br />
                  To Heather he had be the former friend. To Kristine he
                  had been the former lover. To Menya he had been the
                  former boyfriend.<br />
                  <br />
                  Three women at the bar of the Living Well, enjoying a

                  Some ten years have passed since that night three women

                  SCA, when she first joined, we were often<br />
                  co-conspirisors on one political coup or another. Other
                  times I was her target for them.<br />
                  <br />
                  Menya had made an art of her innocent "who me?" look, a
                  look that I will never forget.<br />
                  <br />
                  You will be greatly missed.</td>

                  very difficult to write about my feelings for Menya. I
                  truly believe that without her caring and wisdom I would
                  not have lived very long at all. It's been just over 3
                  years since I was told that I had cancer.<br />
                  <br />
                  Like Menya, I have Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC)<br />
                  &nbsp;<br />
                  Healthy people have no idea how freaky it feels being
                  told one has a rare and potentially lethal disease. The
                  IBC web site and support list Pete and Menya started has
                  literally been a life saver for people all over the world
                  with IBC. Comments come in all the time from list members
                  saying that they wouldn't have been able to cope if it
                  wasn't for the connections they have been able to make
                  with other IBC people through the support list.<br />
                  <br />
                  Not many people know the terror we feel knowing that we
                  have IBC. One feels SO alone and it's of great comfort to
                  finally find a place where there are others on the same
                  path who understand the journey.<br />
                  <br />
                  Menya and I talked often on the phone and I had the
                  pleasure of actually meeting her and Pete twice. Once
                  when they traveled to Ottawa and once when I was passing
                  through Toronto on the way to visit my daughter. I'll
                  miss her crazy laughter. Her incredible wit and wisdom
                  will astound me forever. Those who knew her personally
                  will understand my feelings of loss. Those who only knew
                  her through cyber space will also understand. She touched
                  us all. She had a heart so big.<br />
                  <br />
                  She loved Pete with a passion and once told me that she
                  was the luckiest woman on earth to have him for a soul
                  mate.<br />
                  I wish Pete the strength to cope with the loss of Menya.
                  If it's of any help, there are hundreds of other people
                  from the IBC support list who feel the same.<br />
                  <br />
                  At a later date, when my heart is a little less sore, I
                  will try to write some of the silly memories I have of
                  Menya. We laughed together often.<br />

                  Hi this Sarah, I'm from the ibc list. I was diagnosed
                  recently and although I never coresponded with Menya
                  directly I could sense she was a woman of great warmth
                  and life. I am indebted to her for starting the ibc list.
                  Just to know I am not alone. Her strength and courage is
                  inspiring. This is part of a song I wrote when I lost a
                  dear friend that I would like to share with you. I don't
                  know what else to say.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
                  look to the light, I feel your embrace<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought
                  to my knees, humbled in grace<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will
                  you stay for awhile, here by my side<br />

                  speak of your love, I keep it alive<br />

                  <br />
                  Menya, I will miss you. We shared wonderful times
                  together, what seems forever ago when we were still free
                  and confident and the world was young and bright.<br />
                  <br />
                  I remember well how you and your friend Monica greeted me
                  when I arrived at the SCA meeting that fall of 1983 - a
                  couple of giddy girls you seemed to my
                  oh-so-sophisticated graduate student self. I remember the
                  Alice-in-Wonderland-dress and the closet party and
                  extinguishing the Eternal Flame and many other wild
                  adventures. You always will be that impish, wild,
                  dangerous girl when I think of you.<br />
                  <br />
                  I remember well sharing music with you - the Soldiers
                  Three rehearsing in my room, or at the Pagan Palace, or
                  just singing and playing together for the companionship
                  of it. Though we often sang of drink and debauchery, I
                  think you always loved the melancholy songs best, the
                  laments and the dirges, the ballads of loss and
                  sacrifice. You will always be that singer with sad eyes
                  when I think of you.<br />
                  <br />
                  I remember well sharing joy with you. You were the
                  catalyst that brought my life and Monica's life together.
                  Although we were going different ways when first we met,
                  it was your constant friendship that kept bringing us
                  together so that our own love could grow. You stood with
                  us at our wedding, sharing the solemn and happy moment
                  with us. And you still were the imp, who wormed out the
                  secret get-away we had thought was totally secure. You
                  will always be that laughing friend, co-conspirator and
                  constant helper, when I think of you.<br />
                  <br />
                  I remember well sharing trouble with you. When our son
                  Michael was born and we had to learn to accept his
                  disability, you were always there. You were there despite
                  the thousands of miles that separated us, and you would
                  call just to let us talk to you, to voice our fears, to
                  help us carry our burden for a short time. And I remember
                  when you called to share your burden with us, how you
                  told us of your cancer and how suddenly we realized that
                  we really had no burden at all. You will always be that
                  generous caring sister when I think of you.<br />
                  <br />
                  Menya, you lived with courage and dignity, with laughter
                  and tears, with love, with generosity, and ultimately
                  with acceptance. All these things you shared with us, and
                  we are the richer for it.<br />
                  Menya, you were and are and will be the best of
                  friends.<br />
                  <br />

                  Brother Bill and I visited Menya at St. Mike's after a
                  surgery there. Bill had left to pick up the Thai food and
                  I was wheeling Menya around for some hospital "fresh
                  air". We found, after what seemed like ages of asking
                  staff who curiously didn't know where to direct us, the
                  Chapel. In the Chapel, Menya sang. I had not heard her
                  sing before. From Menya's lips came the most angelic
                  sounds. The ease with which the tones came, and their
                  beauty..... They filled the room and my heart.
                  Afterwards, Pete and Bill played some very cute and
                  entertaining game of peek-a-boo with an ancient statue in
                  a foyer....</td>

                  obviously not enough room here to say everything I want
                  to say about Menya and Pete. So I will say this. It was
                  fate that intervened through a very unusual series of
                  circumstances that put me into Pete and Menya's world. I
                  know they each felt very lucky to have each other. I feel
                  doubly lucky to have known them both.<br />
                  <br />
                  Menya has left for me an incredible gift. The gift of
                  ultimate courage. No matter how dreadful or tedious the
                  day I'm having, I have only to think of what Menya went
                  through and how she handled her circumstances with such
                  grace and dignity and positive action. Somehow, my day
                  automatically gets better, especially when I recall the
                  supercilious eyebrow that she could arch so well or the
                  wicked laugh and rapier wit with which she used so
                  effectively so often.<br />
                  <br />
                  I will always treasure the quiet talks she and I had,
                  about a wide range of subjects, from drug treatments to
                  Shakespeare to religious morality, and I will always
                  marvel at both she and Pete's ultimate courage in being
                  able to ask their friends for help. It takes special
                  people to be able to do this, and I was honoured to be
                  allowed into their lives, in both good times and bad. To
                  my soeur de saucisson, the Beatrice to my Benedict, I
                  salute you, Menya----player of bridge and harp, lover of
                  chocolate, and now, guardian angel. Keep the fires of
                  Valhalla warm for the rest of us, for if ever anyone
                  deserved to be in the hall of heroes, it is certainly
                  you.<br />

                  <td valign="top" width="95%" colspan="2">I spent a lot of
                  time with Menya over the years. As a child, we visited
                  frequently. As a pre-teen, she designed some seriously
                  strange store windows for me. As a teenager, she was
                  there to welcome me when I came home with my new baby.
                  She was planning to "run" things for me while I coped
                  with the little one. IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. I cooked and
                  scrubbed and laundered. Menya cuddled. She sang
                  spontaneous little baby songs and the bond was formed. In
                  the years that followed, Menya came to our summer house
                  with us, was child-tender extraordinaire, "keeper of the
                  canoe key", resident artist, as well as inventor of rainy
                  day games and strange kitchen concoctions. It was a
                  delight to know I could just goof off because I didn't
                  worry too much about cooking or scrubbing or laundry
                  there. We just laughed and did very weird things -- an
                  activity which suited her admirably.. She used to start
                  those summer mornings with the ritual greeting of "Hello
                  Ant" and insisted that I reply "Hello Nice". She had a
                  high opinion of herself even then!<br />
                  <br />
                  Watching her grow up was a pleasure. Her interests were
                  so varied that she didn't seem to have any focus -- just
                  a scattergun approach to life. Then one day everything
                  clicked and came together and I think she rolled every
                  funny little skill she had into one career. What a way to
                  go through life -- be crazy and manage to make it
                  work!<br />
                  <br />
                  I'm sure going to miss you, kid -- and your wisecracks
                  about all my musical shortcomings. Thank you for leaving
                  a little of yourself with everyone who knew you -- and
                  for the free babysitting all those years ago.</td>

                  High School at Northern Secondary. She was a grade behind
                  me but we were in the same choir class. An imp back then,
                  she drove the music teacher crazy one April's Fools Day
                  by taking all his white chalk and replacing it with
                  coloured chalk, changing the colours throughout the day.
                  She also wrapped the piano like a present.<br />
                  <br />
                  She joined the SCA soon after I had, and we spent a lot
                  of time singing together. In those early days, people
                  sometimes confused our names, (just call us Menica and
                  Monya), but that didn't last too long as she soon earned
                  a place for herself.<br />
                  <br />
                  I recall her mooning over a harp in the window of Remenyi
                  Music, then making that trip to Ottawa to build her first
                  harp with Naon. I remember her early attempt to drive
                  during an SCA trip to Waterloo. I remember her pranks,
                  slumber parties in her residence room, camping at
                  Pennsic, singing and playing with Soldier's Three, and
                  many interesting conversations as Phil and I courted,
                  ("Life is a Shakespearean Comedy").<br />
                  <br />
                  Menya, I am sorry we had to live so far away these last
                  years. I am glad you found such a loving and caring
                  husband in Pete. I am glad I did see you last fall, where
                  despite your illness, you still maintained your wry sense
                  of humour. I shall miss you,<br />

                  to get copies of her music. Unfortunately, she decided
                  that her personna was illiterate, and would only teach
                  the music by rote (which doesn't work well when you live
                  in a different city). In the last year, having finally
                  obtained copies of her lyrics, I was working with her to
                  transcribe the actual music. The musical notation of her

                  Some characters are described as "two dimensional", some
                  as "three dimensional". Describing Menya as "three
                  dimensional" just doesn't do her justice - she was "n
                  dimensional". There are just so many different sides to
                  her character, roles that she played, different contexts
                  that she was comfortable in. It really needs a bulletin
                  board like this where the many of us can contribute our
                  pieces of the overall mosaic. And we still won't do her
                  justice.<br />
                  <br />
                  I knew her for about twenty years. Sometimes we were
                  closer, some times we were further apart. We shared an
                  apartment for a while. And years went by (or seemed to)
                  when we didn't see each other. In those twenty years
                  there were a few sides of her that I saw, others that I
                  know of but never experienced personally. It's hard to
                  pick out which stories to tell.<br />
                  <br />
                  I met Menya in the SCA. She had a lot of friends there.
                  Many in high places - others in not so high places.
                  People have referred to her "network of operatives". For
                  a while she had quite the reputation for the deviousness
                  of her plotting. It was best not to offend her; one could
                  get burned. I remember once in the mid-1980s when I was
                  autocrating an event with a Hundred Years War theme, I
                  thought a riddle/quest activity might add to the
                  enjoyment of the day. Perhaps a bit of French/English
                  espionage. Knowing Menya's penchant for plotting, I asked
                  her to set something up. Menya accepted and kept me
                  updated on the progress of the "plot". She gave me a role
                  to play on the day of the event. I was to listen for a
                  particular password and give a small scroll only to the
                  person who got it right. Meanwhile, Menya had been
                  arranging the plot with quite a number of her
                  "operatives". The thing is, it was not a French/English
                  plot, but rather a plot to fool me into thinking that
                  there was an espionage game going on. She'd keep
                  coralling different people and sending them along to me
                  with passwords that she made up on the spot. The plan was
                  that I was to get all excited about a game that didn't
                  exist (as everyone but me knew). She hadn't been happy,
                  you see, with being typecast as a plotter and I needed to
                  be taught a lesson. So learn my lesson and don't just see
                  her as the imp she was.<br />
                  <br />
                  For a while there in the SCA, Menya and I hung around the
                  same group of friends, who met alot outside group
                  meetings and events. I got to see other sides of Menya.
                  During our role playing sessions, for example. I remember
                  the science fiction game where Menya played a Vargir
                  character (a wolf-like species, of course) who was one of
                  our Pirate Quartet. Who could forget her character's
                  Donkey Kong addiction or fondness for howling operas - or
                  the time we hijacked an interstellar shipment of
                  Glenfyddich only to find an imperial plant.<br />
                  <br />
                  Others have written about Menya's creative side. She
                  seemed adept at whatever art she turned her hand to, with
                  whatever tool. I remember her challenge to herself to
                  learn the harp to performance level within the space of a
                  year - a challenge she met (as most of you know; for most
                  the picture that first comes to mind of Menya is one with
                  a harp). She was also adept at writing words and music,
                  calligraphy and illumination, enamelling, metalwork and a
                  host of other SCA skills. But I also remember her
                  mastering the mouse as a drawing tool, long before she
                  got her tablet (and master it she did; it was incredible
                  the things she could draw with it!). I saw (and heard) a
                  lot of her creative side when I was fortunate enough to
                  share an apartment with her.<br />
                  <br />
                  My chief memories of her from that time, however, are the
                  smaller things. I will never be able to see dolmades (the
                  Greek stuffed grape leaves) without thinking of Menya.
                  They were readily available in the market down the street
                  and Menya, enjoying them, liked to keep herself stocked.
                  Menya was not one to deny herself the small pleasures
                  that life can afford if the opportunity to avail herself
                  of them presented itself. It didn't suprise me at all to
                  find that she had ended up in a house with a
                  jacuzzi.<br />
                  <br />
                  This is getting pretty long, and I've only just started
                  to scratch the surface. I'll let someone else have a
                  chance to reveal another side of the many-faceted Menya.
                  For she surely was a jewel.</td>

                  testament to her indelible touch.<br />
                  <br />
                  I was in hospital durring one of her radiation
                  treatments, and she would occasionaly drop by on her way
                  home. My mother was having difficulty with my illness
                  (mental) and we were not really speaking. One day my
                  mother and I were sitting in the lounge, not speaking,
                  when Menya appeared. She bounced down the hallway in her
                  winter coat and a little cap, and sat in the chair in
                  between us. I don't remember all of what she said, but
                  she drew my mother and I into a conversation which lasted
                  all of 20 minutes. After she left, my mother and I kept
                  talking. And we have continued to do so for several
                  years.<br />
                  <br />
                  We have heard so much of Menya's "pranking", but she also
                  used her ability to sum up what was critial in a person
                  to smooth and facillitate where there was pain.<br />
                  <br />
                  One way or another, she will always be in my life. I will
                  cry, but you will still be there. Thank you.<br />

                  "stupid peer trick." We were all waiting around for a
                  Laureling to happen (Balderic's, for those of you in the
                  SCA--I believe he was in the loo) so the Queen called for
                  a stupid peer trick. Rhiannon stepped up and proceeded to
                  play her harp--with a loaf of bread. It was extremely
                  goofy, but it was the deranged expression on her face
                  that made it.<br />
                  <br />
                  I also remember that blue drink she mixed for me at my
                  wedding shower (who knows what was in there?) that led to
                  bouts of dancing on the roof and formerly sedate party
                  attendees to start howling with laughter at balloons
                  placed in rude positions.<br />
                  <br />
                  On the serious side, she provided the music at my
                  wedding, although I'll be danged if I can remember any of
                  it. I think I walked down the aisle to one of the songs
                  she wrote for Septentria.<br />

                  stories told at at the memorial was the one about Menya's
                  birthmark. She would say, "I have a birthmark that you
                  couldn't see if I was standing on the beach in a string
                  bikini", and then offer to show it to you for $5.00 (more
                  or less depending on how cute you were).<br />
                  &nbsp;What I'm not sure about is whether she used this
                  pick-up line on Pete when they first met in person, nor
                  whether Pete used his immortal line: "Do you want to see

                  <td valign="top" width="95%" colspan="2">Susan Clark has
                  reminded me -- Menya made me a drink too, in a great
                  tumbler, with an entire peeled banana mashed across the
                  top of it no less! 'Way more rum than coke, if I recall
                  correctly (surprised I remember it at all). It was served
                  with a fiendish grin.<br />
                  <br />
                  I first met Menya in the Eaton Centre of all places, in
                  1985. She was in the company of David Tallan. I was in
                  the company of Tarver. All of them made a deep impression
                  on my 21-year-old self -- I instantly knew that my
                  decision to join the SCA meant that I would meet the most
                  fascinating people in the world. I spent years making
                  sure I could sit near her and listen when she would play
                  and sing.<br />
                  <br />
                  Menya played and danced during my wedding feast. I wish I
                  had better photos of that, not to mention a
                  recording.<br />
                  <br />
                  Many of you know the story about how twelve of us,
                  including Menya, were stuck in an elevator during a New
                  Year's Eve costume party. We had a Polaroid camera and a
                  good store of alcohol with us, so we managed to have a
                  memorable time despite our unfortunate circumstances. I
                  gave one of the snapshots to Pete and Menya -- it shows
                  Menya dressed like an angel (silvery halo included!),
                  with the sweetest, most innocent expression on her face.
                  It would be fun to have on the Web site.<br />
                  <br />
                  Menya once wrote a song about a friend in the UK. I loved
                  the music, but I joked with her about how *utterly*
                  meaningless the lyrics were to those of us millions who
                  hadn't met this (no-doubt terrific) 'Mereddin' person. I
                  wrote completely different lyrics for our friend Vychata,
                  and actually sang them out loud (in front of other
                  people) (yep) at a Pennsic one year. I can still sing
                  that song. I haven't heard a recording of the original.
                  Is there a chance that I possess the last clear memory of
                  this simple but effective melody? I hope not! There must
                  be another harp-playing friend who can still perform this
                  song?<br />
                  <br />
                  Menya and I were almost exactly the same age. (I made the
                  most of my two weeks' seniority, that goes without
                  saying.) Over the years, we sometimes lived in the same
                  building, even the same apartment, and our acquaintance
                  was constant except while she was in England. She was
                  very good to me when I was the one with cancer, and
                  perhaps because I have survived and she hasn't, I have a
                  lingering feeling that I didn't do enough to pay her back
                  for that and all else.<br />
                  <br />
                  Thanks for everything, Menya.</td>

                  fond of playing [major pun warning] the wolfe in sheep's

                  posting the picture, Pete!<br />
                  <br />
                  I remember that there were twelve people in the elevator
                  -- eight women and four men. The women sat on the floor
                  of the elevator, while the men stood around the
                  walls.<br />
                  <br />
                  I have a second picture of the same scene (not including
                  Menya). I'll see if I can find it.<br />
                  <br />
                  This was actually a "Dante" party. Chris Kowalchuk was
                  Dante, and David Tallan was Virgil, as I recall. Chris
                  played it up, dressing as a tourist with a camera and
                  everything. Gunnar was, er, he was . . . Jesus Christ.
                  Yep, business card and all.<br />
                  <br />
                  As Gunnar says, we were on our way from Hell (on the 6th
                  floor) to Heaven (on a higher floor), where Menya and I
                  were to be married by the Borgia Pope. (He must have had
                  a day pass or something.)<br />
                  <br />
                  Yes, it's true! I proposed, and she accepted. It was to
                  be a marriage made in heaven -- that went straight to
                  hell.<br />
                  <br />
                  We spent our time in purgatory singing 1970s elevator
                  songs ("My name is Michael, I got a nickel" etc.) and
                  conducting poetry readings.<br />
                  <br />
                  The people I can see here (forgive the mixture of
                  real/SCA names) are Hector, Madinia, Kim, Menya, and me.
                  Hector's big kilt is front and centre. Others I know were
                  there include Chris and David (maybe Tara?). The other
                  picture shows more people, I know.<br />
                  <br />
                  After our hour in Purgatory, Menya and I decided that
                  perhaps our marriage was not in the cards. We called it
                  off, and next New Year's Eve I married Kim instead --
                  kazoo band and all. Charles delivered his famous sermon
                  on the subject of Esau and Jacob, as I recall. Most
                  satisfactory.<br />
                  <br />
                  The weird thing is that being stuck in an elevator is not
                  anyone's idea of a good time. However, many of those in
                  the elevator, including Menya, told me in later years
                  that Purgatory was a memorable party-going highlight for
                  them -- and this in an era of fabulous bashes.</td>

                  been Pensic, imagine 10,000 people all trying to live
                  without modern conveniences for two weeks) and we were
                  stopping off for lunch on the road home. We were all
                  still in medieval clothing as we were all fond of
                  'freaking the mundanes' and sat down at a table
                  together.<br />
                  &nbsp;Menya got this incredible expression of wonder on
                  her face as she looked down at the table. She reverently
                  and gingerly picked up her fork and examined it from
                  several angles while we looked at her with puzzled
                  expressions on our faces.<br />

                  the first people that I met when I moved to Toronto in
                  1993. I have the SCA to thank for that. Once they
                  realized that I was a musician, they introduced me to the
                  musicians of Eoforwick and the rest, as they say, is
                  history.<br />
                  I must admit that my relations with Menya have been, er,
                  interesting; in fact, most of them have been of an erotic
                  nature -- and usually involving Pete! :-)<br />
                  One episode that sticks out (as a testament to her
                  deliciously twisted and shameless sense of humour) was
                  the time that she had asked me if I wanted her to send my
                  regards to Pete. I responded (rather coyly) with the
                  request that she do so in whatever manner she deemed
                  appropriate. The next time I saw Pete, I discovered that
                  she had in fact fulfilled my request -- and apparently in
                  a most fascinating manner! For the sake of decency, I
                  omit the details. :-)<br />
                  Menya is one of the most colourful people I know and I
                  will cherish fondly my memories of her.</td>

                  the postings remembering Menya, I have seen a precedent

                  be talking about Menya, I'd like to say a few things
                  about Pete:<br />
                  Pete, Menya was _indeed_ the luckiest woman in the world
                  to have found you! I have never encountered a more
                  loving, more devoted, and (at the risk of sounding
                  hyperbolic) more saintly husband in my life. (If I did
                  not say so then, this is what motivated the sermon I put
                  in the card I gave you for your thirtieth birthday).
                  Everything that you have done--and are still
                  doing--because of your profound love for Menya moves me
                  deeply. Know, Pete, that I admire you greatly!<br />

                  bursting into full-throated thrum in the middle. But what

                  passing. Although it has been more than a few years since
                  we last exchanged words, I frequently remember the times
                  that we shared. I had heard from Ivor last fall that
                  Menya was very ill, but I had not heard any more since
                  then.<br />
                  &nbsp;She was a very rare and special person, tenacious
                  and honest, and she will be missed. It was she who
                  seriously introduced me to the SCA, and to a wonderful
                  circle of friends who I still think of often. Although
                  that period of my life became confused and unfocused, I
                  am grateful to have had the opportunity to get to know

                  I knew Menya for over 17 years. I met her in Toronto
                  through the SCA. We shared some crazy times, as well as
                  many quiet, intimate ones.<br />
                  <br />
                  I knew she was sick. I tried to stay in touch with her
                  over the years as I moved around the U.S., and I feel
                  terrible that I failed to do so recently. I wish she had
                  known how much I loved her, missed her and admired
                  her.<br />
                  <br />
                  On my last night at Pennsic XXX, when the Baron of
                  Septemptria announced flatly that Mistress Rhiannon was
                  dead, I was not prepared for how shocked I would feel. I
                  sobbed on the shoulder of a kind lady who had known her
                  even longer than I (bless you, lady, I did not even have
                  the sense to ask your name), then I sat by the lake -
                  almost on the exact spot where she and I once spent a
                  night at our first Pennsic giggling and talking - and
                  wept out my grief and my relief that her suffering had
                  ended.<br />
                  <br />
                  I will miss her grace. I will miss her music. I will miss
                  her intelligence and her sharp wit. I will miss the way
                  her eyes would light up with mischief whenever the Imps'
                  Guild was mentioned. I will miss brushing her hair. The
                  world is a much colder place.<br />
                  <br />
                  Rhiannon (for that is the name I called you), please
                  forgive me for not saying good-bye.</td>

                  <td valign="top" width="95%" colspan="2">I knew Menya
                  from high school in the 80's. She was what some people
                  may have called a nerd and as I was the same, we became
                  good friends.<br />
                  <br />
                  Menya's flair for dramatics became evident to me in our
                  grade 10 history class. We were doing skits on events
                  that transpired in Canada during the 20's and 30's. Our
                  sketch consisted of flashbacks of events leading up to
                  the stock market crash and how they affected a somewhat
                  dysfunctional family surviving the great
                  depression.<br />
                  <br />
                  Menya and I played a husband/wife team duped by some
                  shady stock market financiers. We were dressed to the
                  nines and had incredibly stupid expressions plastered on
                  to our faces. When we were told to "sign on the dotted
                  line.." Menya plucked the feather from my headdress ( a
                  brilliant piece of improvisation), and signed "B. Dunne".
                  The class then cracked up because Menya had given the
                  name of the class teacher who was sitting at his desk
                  looking somewhat surprised.<br />
                  <br />
                  I'm sure I told this story many times to anyone who would
                  listen. When Menya could no longer speak, she still
                  smiled when I reminded her of it.</td>

                  &nbsp;Hi All<br />
                  I was fortunate enough to have been able to take part in
                  Menya's care team. This message board (Pete, you rock)
                  has been a great help over the last year. I don't think
                  I've added anything though, so here goes. I made this
                  addition to the blue book last summer, and it's about
                  last Feb 13th, the day Menya died.<br />
                  <br />
                  This is written months later of the day that Menya died.
                  When I stepped off the elevator that evening to visit,
                  the ward felt different. Ian met me in the hall and asked
                  if I would go into the quiet room with him for a moment.
                  I could see his news on his face, mingled with the
                  desperation to do the job of informing people right. I
                  stood my ground outside her room and asked him to just
                  tell me what I already knew. She had passed away barely
                  10 minutes before, that Pete was with her right now, that
                  he'd called her family and said Menya had taken a turn
                  but not how sharply because that's just not the sort of
                  thing you hear over the phone. I told him he'd done very
                  well, that the news had been perfectly delivered.<br />
                  <br />
                  I stepped inside the curtain drawn around her bed to see
                  Pete kneeling beside her, holding her hand, looking at
                  her face. His eyes held a mixture of relief, longing and
                  love. In the coming hours many friends and family came
                  by. With the generous and competent care of one of the
                  nurses (and while once again listening to "Woodland
                  Harp") I helped to change Menya into some clothing picked
                  out earlier in the week for just that purpose; black
                  skirt, burgundy batik top. Brushed hair, new lip-gloss.
                  Perfume. I left her with a silver chain with an amber
                  apple pendant - apples being the symbol of the Norse
                  goddess Idun, the eternal maiden - I felt that was
                  somewhat appropriate. I was amazed at the temperature
                  changes in her body, at a newly added weight, but most of
                  all by the look of peace and total joy her face had
                  settled into. Seeing her then dressed in her own cloths
                  was extremely important. She looked the perfect and
                  powerful queen. There was a strong sense of clan around
                  her, which I will always feel privileged to have been a
                  part of. The funeral home was called and her father and
                  brother waited with her to attend her out of the
                  building; Menya's body therefore skipped the standard
                  trip to the hospital morgue. As a devout non-conformist,
                  I know this would have pleased her.<br />
                  <br />
                  Some felt her presence, others her absence, but I think
                  all felt the beginning of a hole in our lives that would
                  be made by Menya's death. How we fill that, I think, will
                  be a reflection of all she taught us and of our love for
                  her.</td>

                  OKAY. THE FAMILY CAN EXHALE.. SHE WAS DOING SO GOOD,
                  ALERT AS SHE COULD EVER BE. SHE KNEW HER NAME, THE DATE,
                  WHERE SHE WAS AT. SHE LOOKED LIKE SHE WAS ALRIGHT. A
                  COUPLE OF DAYS LATER WAS VALENTINE'S DAY 2002. THE FAMILY
                  WENT UP THERE IS SPEND VALENTINE'S DAY WITH. THEY WERE
                  WITH HER ALL NIGHT. THEY SAID SHE WAS DOING SO GOOD THAT
                  SHE WILL BE ABLE TO DO HOME THAT NEXT MONDAY. MEANWHILE
                  HER SISTER AND I WENT OUT OF TOWN FOR THE WEEKEND. SHE
                  WAS DOING SO GOOD. MONDAY CAME SHE WENT HOME. WE DIDN'T
                  GO OVER THERE WE TIRED FROM DRIVING DURING OUR WEEKEND
                  VACTION. THE NEXT MORNING WE GET A CALL. SONIA FELL AND
                  HIT HER HEAD AND IS BACK IN THE HOSPITAL. SHE IS NOT
                  DOING SO WELL. WE FIND OUT THAT HER WAS CAUSED BY A
                  STROKE FROM THE OTHER SIDE HER BRIAN. OKAY WE CAN DEAL
                  WITH SHE JUST HAVE TO HAVE THERAPY BUT SHE'LL BE OKAY.
                  THE NEXT DAY SHE IS REALLY SLEEPY WANTS TO SLEEP ALL TIME
                  SHE IS STILL TALKING. I THOUGHT WELL MAYBE IT'S JUST BEST
                  FOR HER TO REST SO HER BRIAN CAN HEAL. HOW IRONIC.....
                  NEVER ONCE DID SHE SAY SHE WAS SCARED, SHE NEVER SHOWED
                  IT. SHE CONSTANTLY TOLD HER FAMILY SHE LOVED THEM. SHE
                  ALWAYS REACHED TO TOUCH WHEN YOU LEFT HER HOPSTIAL ROOM.
                  SHE CAN'T KEEP HER EYES OPEN. SHE TELLS EVERYONE SEVERAL
                  TIMES THAT SHE WANTED TO SEE HER DAUGHTER. THE PASTOR
                  COMES TO PRAY FOR. HER REPLY WAS THAT SHE IS GOING TO BE
                  ALRIGHT. SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS REALLY TIRED AND THE
                  NURSES WOULD WAKE HER UP CHECKING ON HER EVERY 30 MINS.
                  THE FAMILY WENT HOME. THATS THE LAST WE TALK TO HER. NOT
                  EVEN A GOOD HOUR AFTER WE LEFT SHE HAD ANOTHER STROKE,
                  HER BRIAN COULD HANDLE THE BLOOD THAT HER STRONG HEART
                  WAS PUMPING. HER BRIAN SHUT DOWN. THE ONLY THING THAT WAS
                  KEEPING HER ALIVE WAS THE MACHINE THAT WAS PULLED INTO
                  THE WALL. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED. SHE WAS JUST
                  FEEL A FEW DAYS AGO. HER SISTER AND HER MOTHER DECIDED TO
                  TAKE HER OFF OF LIFE SUPPORT. SHE IS IN A PLACE WHERE SHE
                  WON'T EVER AGAIN. WE REALLY MISS HER. HER FURNERAL IS
                  THIS SATURDAY.</td>
