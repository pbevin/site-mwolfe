Handfasting Song
Spring 1984
This was written for a pagan couple who were married, and has since become a favourite in that community. Menya always liked riddle songs, especially the ones where the man really just wants to have his way and the woman is testing him.

Woman: I'll sing you a riddle of water and earth, 
Who was the mother that gave us all birth?
Who cradles and comforts and nurses us still, 
Answer me my love

Man: I'll sing you the answer with copper and bone, 
She dwells in the fountain and also the stone.
The lady's our mother, the day it is done,
Come to me my love.

Woman: I'll sing you a riddle of fire and air,
Who is the father that keeps us from care?
Who stands as a guardian when danger is near, 
Answer me my love.

Man: I'll sing you the answer with morning and night,
His voice is the thunder, his smile the light.
The Lord is our father, the day it is done,
Come to me my love.

Woman: I'll sing you a riddle of chalice and sword,
What can be greater than Lady or Lord?
What was the beginning of all living things,
Answer me my love.

Man: I'll sing you the answer with bitter and sweet,
The world was created when these two did meet.
Their union is greater, the day it is done,
Come to me my love.

Woman: I'll sing you a riddle of legend and lore.
How long will this union of unions endure?
How long will it last, and when will it end?
Answer me my love.

Man: I'll sing you the answer with myrtle and rue, 
It cannot last longer than my love for you.
The answer's forever, the day it is done,
Come to me my love.

Both: Come to me my love.
Come to me my love.
