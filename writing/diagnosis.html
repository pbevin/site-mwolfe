<h1>Diagnosis</h1>
When Menya went to the breast clinic on April 17th, it was just one of life's 
little inconveniences. Her family doctor had quite correctly told us that given 
her age and medical history, it was 95% likely to be a cyst. I didn't even bother 
going in with her.

Guys,<br>On Wednesday, Menya was told that she has breast cancer.<br>The diagnosis isn't complete yet, although we do definitely know that<br>it's cancer.  They're putting her through various tests in the next<br>couple of weeks to find out whether it's spread to anywhere else,<br>and based on that, they'll recommend a course of treatment, which will<br>probably involve chemotherapy and surgery.<br>I have to tell you that this is pretty serious.  The lump is pretty<br>big, and Menya is in the age group where it tends to be more acute.<br>Even when they treat this, there's a chance of recurrence.<br>We still don't know what we're going to do.  We're trying to decide<br>whether it would be best for Menya to be treated here or back home<br>in Toronto -- it's a pretty difficult decision.  We'll know more when<br>we know what the treatment is going to be.<br>Obviously, we'll keep you all up to date.  Please don't tell people who<br>don't already know.  I know that's hard, but it may be important to us<br>to have people around who don't know.  (Partners are fine...)  And<br>please keep in touch, especially if we leave the country.  Your support<br>through all this will be very valuable.<br>Pete and Menya.</pre>

<p>I got a phone call at 11:30am from the hospital, asking me to come at once. 
  All they would tell me over the phone was that she had been given &quot;bad 
  news&quot;. As I drove the 20 miles to the hospital, I tried to figure out how 
  serious it might be. Was it the hospital being over-dramatic, was it that Menya 
  had a week to live - or was it somewhere in between?</p>
<p>[no info from docs]</p>
<p>[how did we feel? Numb...]</p>
<p>[bitch at hospital]</p>
<p>[reaction emails]</p>
<p class="email-header">It wasn't a hard decision to move to Canada. Menya wanted 
  to be near her friends and family, and the Canadian health care system seemed 
  like a much better idea at the time - a good analysis, as it turned out. We 
  threw a party to say goodbye to our friends, closed down our affairs in Britain 
  as best we could, and bought two plane tickets to Toronto.</p>
