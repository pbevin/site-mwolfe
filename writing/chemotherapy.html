&gt;  How are you? How is your work going?<br>
Oh, boy...do we have a lot to catch up on :-)<br>
Right now, I'm sitting in my apartment in Toronto.  The computer equipment<br>arrived a few weeks ago, and I've just got around to setting it up.  I<br>should be starting work in the next couple of weeks.<br>
OK.  Here's the story.  In mid-April, Menya found a lump in her breast,<br>which turned out to be cancer -- one of the worst types, as it turned out.<br>So we dropped everything and moved to Canada so that she could be with her<br>family and friends.  Life's still pretty hectic as we recover from the<br>move, but it's sorting itself out.<br>
Menya's pretty much living as normal right now: she isn't in hospital or<br>anything.  She's just over half way through her first chemotherapy<br>treatment -- she'll have surgery in September, followed by more<br>chemotherapy, and then radiation.  She's on a high-dose chemo, which made<br>her hair fall out, and she's often quite tired, but that's about it.  And<br>the lump is getting a lot smaller than it was -- the doctors are mildly<br>surprised by how well she's doing.<br>
The prognosis isn't all that good, unfortunately.  About 5 years ago,<br>before they started using chemotherapy, the 5-year survival rate for her<br>type of breast cancer (inflammatory) was 2%.  Now it's about 40%.  Chances<br>are, she'll have mastectomy, though sometimes they can just take the lump<br>out.
<br>Apart from that, Toronto's a good place to live right now, and I'd<br>recommend it.  The cost of living is very cheap, and there's always a lot<br>to do.  We're living very close to the city centre, and it's nice to be<br>able to walk everywhere.  There's certainly no need to get a car,<br>fortunately!<br>
The weather's very good, too -- fortunately, it's a mild Summer, which<br>means it doesn't get above 30C very much.  Sometimes, it can get up to<br>40C, though we have air conditioning in the apartment for times like that.<br>The Winter should be more fun -- five months of mainly sub-zero<br>temperatures.  Fortunately, Menya's sister lives in Louisiana, so we'll<br>probably escape there for a couple of weeks if it gets too much.<br>
So...did you get anywhere with learning Java?  I've been doing some recently
to try and stop the computer part of my brain from atrophying.  If you're
bored some time, take a look at this crappy applet I wrote.  One day, I'll<br>get around to writing something worthwhile -- maybe once I get something<br>bigger than a 386 to work on!

Pete.
