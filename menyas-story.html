<h1>Menya's Story (written in February 2000)</h1>
<blockquote> Breast cancer was the last thing on my mind. I was only 31, and my 
  life was just coming together. I'd met a wonderful man and moved to live with 
  him in the UK, my graduate thesis was finally done, and one of the top art restorers 
  in London had hired me and was training me in the restoration of priceless antiquities. 
  Then I found a lump in my breast while lying in bed one morning in March of 
  1996. It was <strong>big </strong>, probably 10cm long and at least half as 
  wide. I saw a doctor quickly, and was told it was almost certainly a cyst, given 
  the size and my age. No-one was in much of a hurry to investigate further. By 
  the time I was seen by a specialist at the local hospital a month later, the 
  breast was swollen and red, the skin was dimpled, the nipple was flat and I 
  had palpable nodes under the arm. I was still naively assuming it was benign, 
  but the doctor must have known it was IBC as soon as he laid eyes on me. 
  <p>After two days of agonizing, Pete and I decided that I would be better being 
    treated in my native Canada with family and friends around. We quit our jobs, 
    arranged travel and packed to fly back two weeks after my diagnosis. In Canada 
    we had to arrange accommodation and I began treatment as soon as I could. 
    Neither of us could work in the beginning, since I was in treatment and Pete 
    had no work permit, and we were turned down for government assistance, so 
    we had to borrow from family to get by. That period was possibly the most 
    stressful of my life. Eventually work turned up for him, and my response to 
    chemotherapy was good, so the cloud started to lift a little.</p>
  <p>The chemotherapy I was given is about the strongest available in Canada at 
    that time to IBC patients without distant metastases. Initially I had high 
    dose CEF (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin and fluorouracil), but after the first 
    round and a severe case of neutropenia, the F drug was dropped, the others 
    increased, and neupogen injections added to keep my white blood counts up. 
    I was really lucky, and had little nausea, moderate fatigue and a few other 
    manageable side effects. The loss of my hair was really hard, and at first 
    I hid my baldness from everyone, but by the end of the six months I was going 
    bareheaded most of the time. I didn't have to work during chemo, but I suspect 
    I could have managed part-time.</p>
  <p>After six months of chemotherapy, I had a modified radical mastectomy. I 
    had always been very large-chested, and was having an elective breast reduction 
    on the other side at the same time, so it made the whole thing a much less 
    negative experience than it might have been. A week after my surgery, while 
    recovering from a post-op infection in hospital, I was given my pathology 
    report. It couldn't have been better: no residual cancer, clear nodes, and 
    no sign the cancer had ever been there. The relief was incredible, and it 
    was like the emotional dam finally burst. For weeks I went through sorrow, 
    anger, frustration, and all kinds of other feelings.</p>
  <p>Radiation was made easier by the knowledge that I had beaten the odds so 
    far, and that I had a decent chance of long-term survival. It was tiring, 
    and irritating to have to go across town every day in the middle of winter, 
    but I got through, and finished nine months after beginning chemotherapy. 
    It still took a long time to recover my energy. After several months I was 
    doing regular exercise classes and spending time upgrading my computer skills, 
    hoping that the worst was behind me and that I'd stay disease-free.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately cancer hit again eight months later, in the form of a brain 
    metastasis. It was discovered by CT scan after I'd felt a bit fuzzy headed 
    and clumsy for a few months, then had a week or two of bad dizzy spells. The 
    timing was lousy, ten days before our October 5 wedding. I was put on high 
    doses of Decadron, and we went ahead with both the wedding and the honeymoon 
    in Jamaica, since it was taking time to get test results and devise a treatment 
    plan. Nothing was said at the wedding, but all the guests had been told, and 
    although we were under stress, we felt really supported by people. We knew 
    that if the tumour wasn't operable, odds were I'd be dead within a year.</p>
  <p>An MRI showed the tumour to be solitary and operable, and there was no sign 
    of cancer elsewhere, so the neurosurgeon gave the okay for surgery. The tumour 
    was 3.5cm, high in the left parietal lobe. The greatest risk was of damage 
    to the function of the right arm or leg, but even that was relatively low. 
    Given the alternative, we agreed to the surgery, which was scheduled for six 
    days later, October 27. I had to be awake for the operation, and the hospital 
    where I had the surgery was not well run or pleasant to be in, so the whole 
    experience was pretty awful. I was released three days later with a full head 
    of hair covering the incision.</p>
  <p>The next morning I woke with a swollen leg, and a blood clot was found when 
    I went to Emergency. After a much more pleasant four day stay at my main hospital, 
    I was released with orders for daily injections of blood thinners for at least 
    three months. I was now on Decadron to prevent swelling of the brain, Dilantin 
    to prevent seizures, and Innohep to prevent a potentially lethal embolism. 
    I had a few weeks to rest and then started whole brain radiation.</p>
  <p>My radiation treatments were done in a week, so it was less of a hassle than 
    the chest radiation, but the higher doses caused headaches and extreme fatigue. 
    About two weeks later my hair fell out again, and this time I chose to wear 
    a wig to cover the long incision and the depression left in one area. As time 
    went on, I was able to wean off the Decadron, then the Dilantin, and finally 
    the Innohep. From February 1998 until that September, I was well, built my 
    strength back up, and managed to start working part-time. Despite the brain 
    tumour, we still felt postitive.</p>
  <p>One thing we learned through all of this was that brain mets are a bit different 
    from other recurrences. Since the initial chemo was prevented from effectively 
    treating the brain by a biological barrier, a recurrence there didn't mean 
    that chemotherapy had failed. It wasn't good news, but there was still a chance 
    that with the brain tumour under control, I wouldn't recur again. Unfortunately, 
    the cancer came back in September 1998 in exactly the same place in the brain. 
    The doctors weren't surprised that I'd had a recurrence but they were surprised 
    about the location, since the treatment I'd had usually does a better job 
    than that. The metastatic workup was still clear and there were no other spots 
    in the brain.</p>
  <p>The surgeon wasn't enthusiastic about what he could do for me, since I'd 
    been left with a clumsy hand the first time, and he suggested we look elsewhere. 
    The next obvious step was stereotactic radiosurgery, a focused radiation treatment 
    potentially as effective as surgery. SRS was booked quickly and we were told 
    that it generally worked for at least two years, but that long term results 
    were not available yet. It was a one-day treatment which involved having a 
    metal frame screwed into my head in the morning for scans, and radiation treatment 
    with the frame late in the day after the doctors had sat in a room for several 
    hours, planning the doses and angles needed to do maximum damage to the tumour 
    without hurting the brain around it.</p>
  <p>The next MRI scan looked better, but the one after that was a bit worse again. 
    I took Thalidomide for about five months, but it seemed to have no effect 
    on the growing mass. It could have been tumour growth or radiation damage, 
    but either way, it meant more surgery to cut it out. In January 1999, I had 
    a second awake craniotomy with a second, slightly more encouraging doctor. 
    Even before the surgery I had been having increasing problems with both the 
    right arm and leg, and I had started to have seizures every couple of weeks. 
    We hoped the surgery would clear it up. Things did get better but not for 
    too long, and the post-surgical MRIs started getting worse again.</p>
  <p>W ithout enough tumour there to justify surgery, having had all the radiation 
    I can safely have, but still feeling unable to do most of the things I want 
    to do, we decided to look into less standard approaches. Chemo generally isn't 
    used for brain tumours but my doctor suggested that Methotrexate in very high 
    doses might get through the blood-brain barrier. The doses used range from 
    25 to 125 times the doses used in CMF. There were a bunch of extra precautions 
    and a three to four day hospital stay each time I did it but surprisingly 
    I had fewer side-effects than I would have had at lower doses because a second 
    drug, Leucovorin, flushed the Methotrexate out of my system before it caused 
    severe hair loss, low blood counts, mouth sores, etc.</p>
  <p>In July, after four rounds, the MRI showed a larger mass, so we scrapped 
    the Methotrexate and returned to the chemo I'd had in 1996, since it had worked 
    so well. The September MRI still showed growth, albeit less, but I had hit 
    the maximum lifetime dose, so we needed to change again. By this point so 
    many things had failed that I had resigned myself to never being really well 
    again, and probably being on chemo for however many months I survived. Surprisingly, 
    I hadn't deteriorated much since May even with a lot of growth on the MRI, 
    but I was emotionally and physically drained.</p>
  <p>October 1999 I started Temodal, an experimental drug that hasn't been tested 
    yet on breast cancer (even in the brain, it's still breast cancer). Two months 
    later, another MRI. I was still feeling reasonably well, although incredibly 
    tired. Comments my surgeon had made had left me with the idea that some of 
    the mass might be dead tissue, and I asked for an experimental test that can 
    distinguish tumour from necrosis, in the hope that things might not be as 
    bad as they seemed. The day after the tests, I was told that the mass seemed 
    to be smaller, which was the first good news in almost a year. Better news 
    followed a week later, when the other test indicated that there was no living 
    tumour detectable, that it was all necrosis. An expert in radiosurgery reviewed 
    all of my 1999 MRIs, and said it was possibly necrosis all year, a textbook 
    case of post-treatment damage.</p>
  <p>It was days before Christmas and Y2K celebrations, and I had gone from believing 
    the tumour was resistant to everything and I was going to die, to finding 
    I was free of disease. Even my normally cautious oncologist was talking about 
    the possibility of cure. It was a hard shift to make, even though the news 
    was so good. I had almost lost hope, and had to relearn to dream. There were 
    a lot of sleepless nights as my mind made the adjustment. The physical disabilities 
    are still there. I have limited use of my right hand, a pronounced limp, and 
    I can only walk a few blocks. I don't know how much will come back -- I want 
    to play the harp again, to work with glass and metal, to race in the dragon 
    boat, ride a bike. If I stay well, I'll have the time to relearn some of those 
    things.</p>
  <p>If one person is responsible for my success against IBC so far, it's my husband, 
    Pete. He has given up so much for me, and has been the only stable thing in 
    my life at times. I want to live partly so I can repay him for everything 
    he has done, but I'm not sure anyone could live long enough. I just want everyone 
    to know that there is always hope, that there are survivors. Making contact 
    with an IBC survivor made a huge difference to me when I was newly diagnosed 
    and feeling overwhelmed by it all. It was the hope that it would do the same 
    for others that led Pete and me to create first the IBC mailing list and then 
    this Web site. The birth of a community of friends was an unexpected bonus.</p>
