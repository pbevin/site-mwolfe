				<td valign="top">September 1998</td>
				<td width="70%">Diagnosed with 2cm local recurrence of brain met, clear workup. Stereotactic radiosurgery (15Gy at 95% line).</td>

				<td valign="top">December 1998</td>
				<td width="70%">Began <b>thalidomide</b> 400mg/day, escalating doses.</td>

			<tr>
				<td valign="top">January 1999</td>
				<td width="70%">After initial reduction, regrowth to almost 2cm. <b>Craniotomy</b> (complete resection).</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td valign="top">March 1999</td>
				<td width="70%">MRI showed narrow margin of enhancement lining surgical cavity. Stopped thalidomide after reaching 700mg/day.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td valign="top">May 1999</td>
				<td width="70%">MRI showed increased enhancement and symptoms worsened.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td valign="top">June 1999</td>
				<td width="70%">Began <b>high-dose Methotrexate</b> w/ Leucovorin rescue, 4 doses bi-weekly at 1, 3, 5, and 5 g/m2. MRI showed increased enhancement.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td valign="top">July 1999</td>
				<td width="70%">MRI showed increased enhancement. Cavity almost completely filled and enhanced area measures about 3cm diameter. Stopped Methotrexate.</td>

			<tr>
				<td valign="top">August 1999</td>
				<td width="70%">Started high dose <b>EC</b> with neupogen (as in 1996).</td>

				<td valign="top">Sept 1999</td>
				<td width="70%">MRI showed slight increase, so EC dropped because of potential toxicity.</td>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td valign="top">December 1999</td>
				<td width="70%">No tumour growth on MRI and slight improvement in symptoms. MRS showed no viable tumour in necrotic mass. Stopped chemo on advice of doctors, who reinterpreted all the 1999 MRIs as SRS-related necrosis.</td>

				<td width="70%">Some increase in symptoms, but MRI essentially unchanged.</td>

				<td valign="top">April 2000</td>
				<td width="70%">Symptoms much worse, but attributed to hormones or seizure activity.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td valign="top">May 2000</td>
				<td width="70%">Deficits increasing rapidly, and MRI eventually done a month early. Tumour had doubled or tripled since February, and edema was extensive. Third <b>craniotomy with PDT</b>, again a complete resection, resulting in more right-sided weakness. Post-surgical CT clear.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td valign="top">July 2000</td>
				<td width="70%">CT shows local regrowth to 1.3 cm with considerable edema. <b>Temodal</b> restarted on 5/28 day cycle.</td>

		<p>Menya is currently 35 years old, and there is no evidence of disease outside the brain. There has never been any metastasis anywhere else, and apart from the cancer, she is otherwise healthy. The tumour is in the left parietal lobe, and is affecting her ability to walk (she has a noticeable limp), and to perform fine motor tasks with her right hand. She also reports being less articulate than normal (although she is very articulate to start with) and suffers from occasional focal seizures in her right arm or leg.
