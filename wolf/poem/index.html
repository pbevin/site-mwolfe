[This page was created to demonstrate the use of frames, but I think the poem below is worth reading whatever your browser.]
</P>
<P>
After a while you learn the subtle difference between holding a hand and chaining a soul,<BR>
And you learn that love doesn't mean leaning and company doesn't mean security,<BR>
And you begin to learn that kisses aren't contracts and presents aren't promises,<BR>
And you begin to accept your defeats with your head up and your eyes open, with the grace of an adult, not the grief of a child,<BR>
And you learn to build all your roads on today because tomorrow's ground is too uncertain for plans.<BR>
After a while you learn that even sunshine burns if you get too much.<BR>
So plant your own garden and decorate your own soul, instead of waiting for someone to bring you flowers.<BR>
And you learn that you really can endure...<BR>
That you really are strong,<BR>
And you really do have worth.<BR>
</P>
