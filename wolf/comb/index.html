<CENTER><H2>Here, as promised, are pictures of the various hairstyles
I've gone through in the past year or so.  When I have time, I'll set up
a page where you can vote on your fave do.</H2></CENTER>

<BIG><IMG  WIDTH=200  HEIGHT=200  Align=Left SRC="feb95.jpg">I had long
hair from age 17 until last year.  One of the worst things about
learning I had cancer was knowing the hair, which was one of my best
features and the envy of many friends, was going to go. <P><BR

<IMG  WIDTH=200  HEIGHT=200  Align=Left SRC="may96.jpg">To minimize the
trauma, I had it cut fairly short before starting treatment in May of
1996.  Everyone, including me, liked it.  I may keep it around this
length once it comes back, and it will probably look close to this at
our wedding in October. <P><BR clear=left><HR>

<IMG  WIDTH=200  HEIGHT=200  Align=Left SRC="aug96.jpg">By the first
week of June, it was all gone.  Pete helped me to shave off the last
wisps so I'd at least look tidy.  I spent about six months with no hair,
and I became much less shy by the end, only wearing hats or my wig
around strangers. <P><BR clear=left><HR>

<IMG  WIDTH=200  HEIGHT=200  Align=Left SRC="dec96.jpg">The first new
permanent growth was really nice.  Everyone loved stroking my head to
feel the fuzz, and Theo started grooming me every chance he got.  I
guess he figured I hadn't looked after my old hair or it wouldn't have
fallen out... <P><BR clear=left><HR>

<IMG  WIDTH=200  HEIGHT=200  Align=Left SRC="mar97.jpg">Four months
after finishing chemo, I had my first haircut.  It was nice to be among
the ranks of the normal again.  The top is surprisingly curly, which is
fun.

That's all I have so far, but I'll post more pictures once I look noticeably hairier.
