						<p>There's my family, I suppose. None of them have Home Pages yet,
						<img src="babyp.jpg" align="right" width="123" height="126" alt="baby picture">so you'll have to take my word for their existence. My father,
						<a href="morris.jpg">Morris Wolfe</a> , is a teacher and writer. My mother, <a href="carla.jpg">Carla McKague</a> , is a lawyer and former mathematician. My sister <a href="jen.jpg">Jen</a> is a musician and mother of two, and my brother <a href="ben.jpg">Ben</a> does desktop publishing and has three kids. We're all Mac users,
						which prevents arguments on the merits of different systems.</p>
						<p>Do you want to know my early history? I was born in Hamilton,
						Ontario on September 14, 1964. I was nauseatingly cute as a small
						child, and looked like those paintings of children <img src="boinkp.jpg" align="left" width="130" height="128" alt="boinking with the Moose">with enormous eyes. We moved around a lot, and I went to a number
						of different schools. We settled in Toronto when I was ten. From
						age six to about eighteen, theatre was my main interest. I took
						drama classes, got involved in amateur theatre, and worked part
						time at Young People's Theatre. Then in <a href="http://www.northernsecondary.toronto.on.ca/">high school</a> , my interest shifted to history and <a href="http://www.sca.org/">re-enactment</a> .</p>
						
        <p>I could talk about <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/uoft.html">university</a> 
          (like puberty, thankfully over). I spent almost as much of my life there 
          (ten years more or less) as I've spent asleep. Come to think of it... 
          As a student, I wrote<img src="vikingp.jpg" align="right" width="114" height="125" alt="dressed as a Viking"> 
          countless papers, culminating in a 100-page thesis on experimental archaeology 
          which no-one, including myself, is ever likely to read again.</p>
						<p>I graduated in 1995 with a shiny new master's degree shortly after
						relocating to <a href="http://www-mice.cs.ucl.ac.uk/misc/uk/activemap.html">England</a>. Still, England was full of fascinating history, mild <a href="http://www.wni.com/yahoo/cgi/extended.cgi?aircode=LHR&button_region=eu&graphical=true&units=celsius">weather</a> (compared to <a href="http://www.wni.com/yahoo/cgi/extended.cgi?aircode=YYZ&button_region=na&graphical=true&units=celsius">Canada</a> ), and Englishmen with sexy accents. I'd had a lot of friends
						in the UK for years, partly through archaeological and museum
						work in <img src="petefishp.jpg" align="left" width="114" height="125" alt="I married this?"><a href="http://www.hillside.co.uk/arch/archaeology.html">Canterbury</a> and <a href="http://www.demon.co.uk/past/yat/">York</a> , partly through involvement in <a href="http://www.ftech.net/~regia/">Viking reenactment</a> , but mainly from the Usenet newsgroup <a href="http://www.mimir.com/singles/index.html">uk.singles</a> , which I discovered by chance while I was a grad student. Meeting
						some of these folks face to face has been amusing, educational,
						and in at least one case has led to major changes in my life.</p>
						<p>I moved to the UK in June of 1995 to finish my thesis and cohabit
						with Pete Bevin, aka the Moose. While I was there, I did some
						busking with my lap harp and then<img height="125" width="125" src="keele.jpg" align="right"> found a great job in London doing restoration of antiquities.
						We worked mainly on archaeological pieces intended for resale
						by antiquities dealers, which is a bit of a shady field, but was
						really interesting. I worked mainly on a pair of Etruscan sarcophagi
						I nicknamed Charles and Di because the sculptural figures looked
						like them. <a href="sarc.jpg">Here</a> 's a similar piece from the Louvre with two figures on top, so
						you'll know what I'm talking about.</p>
						
        <p><img height="125" width="125" src="jack.jpg" align="left">Life over 
          there was pretty good, and I had no plans to return to Canada soon. 
          I'd still be there if I hadn't been diagnosed with <a href="http://www.ibcsupport.org/">inflammatory 
          breast cancer</a> in April of 1996. My initial treatment, mainly at 
          the renowned <a href="http://utl2.library.utoronto.ca/www/wch/index.htm">Women's 
          College Hospital</a> in Toronto, included six months of high dose <a href="http://www.nbcc.org.au/pages/clincon/treat/chemo.htm">chemotherapy</a> 
          (EC with GCSF), a modified radical <a href="http://www.nbcc.org.au/pages/clincon/treat/surgery.htm">mastectomy</a> 
          , five weeks of daily <a href="http://www.nbcc.org.au/pages/clincon/treat/radio.htm">radiation</a> 
          treatments and ongoing hormonal therapy with <a href="http://www.graylab.ac.uk/cancernet/600716.html">tamoxifen</a> 
          . I lost all my hair (as you can <a href="comb/">see</a> ), but it came 
          back in time for my <a href="http://www.bestiary.com/wedding/">wedding</a> 
          in October 1997.<img src="baldp.jpg" align="right" width="127" height="128" alt="no hair"></p>
						<p>The prognosis for IBC isn't usually very good. I had a recurrence
						to the brain in September, discovered just 10 days before the
						wedding. Most IBC patients eventually have the disease spread,
						but usually to the skin, bones, liver or lung. Brain tumours are
						difficult to treat (bad), but as the sole site of disease still
						allow the possibility of cure (good). Surgery is normally done
						only if there are just one or two tumours in safe <img height="127" width="127" src="engagementp.jpg" align="left">locations, there is no other disease, and the patient is healthy.
						Without surgery, the odds of making our first anniversary weren't
						good, but there were a lot of tests before we'd know if it was
						operable.We weren't able to find out until after the honeymoon.</p>
						<p>The wedding went ahead at the Elmwood, formerly a private women's
						club, which has a wonderful atmosphere and helpful staff. The
						bride wore garnet and gold, the fecund matron of honour wore hunter
						green, and the menfolk wore double breasted tuxedos with garnet
						and hunter waistcoats. The minister who<img height="127" width="127" src="mrip.jpg" align="right"> married us is an old friend of mine, a tiny Scotswoman with flaming
						tresses. We had 85 guests for a sit-down dinner. The honeymoon
						was at Sandals Ocho Rios, in Jamaica. I was on high doses of steroids
						and we were under a lot of stress, but we still managed to have
						a great time. We went snorkeling, horseback riding in the ocean,
						climbed Dunn's River Falls, and spent a lot of time relaxing in
						or next to the resort's three pools.</p>
						<p><img height="127" width="127" src="kissp.jpg" align="left">I was very lucky and the tumour was solitary and operable. Surgery
						(performed while I was awake) was October 27, with radiation about
						a month later. It took a few months to regain my energy, more
						for my hair to come back a second time, and I was left with some
						residual clumsiness of the right hand, but overall I felt well
						again six months after rediagnosis. I was able to work part time
						doing web graphics, I joined a dragon boat team for breast<img height="125" width="125" src="horsesp.jpg" align="right"> cancer survivors, and by the summer of 1998, I started to dare
						to hope and make plans again. After all, I was told that 80% of
						operable metastatic brain tumours don't come back.</p>
						<p>We were feeling pretty good about things, and came into some unexpected
						money, enough for a down payment on a house. We found a place
						fairly quickly that was pretty luxurious for two, with an open
						concept main floor, a jacuzzi in the bathroom, separate studies
						and a cathedral ceiling in the bedroom. It's near downtown in
						a really <img height="126" width="126" src="pacing.jpg" align="left">friendly neighbourhood full of film people and kids. I had high
						hopes for the garden despite my total lack of experience, but
						so far have only managed to keep it from going completely wild
						with the help of friends. Unfortunately my holiday from treatment
						ended just days after we moved in.</p>
						<p>The tumour recurred in exactly the same place in September 1998.
						The surgeon wasn't encouraging about more surgery given the risk<img height="125" width="125" src="housep.jpg" align="right"> of disability, so I opted for Stereotactic Radiosurgery, a focused
						radiation blast to the tumour. 95% of the time, it controls tumour
						growth for at least a year or two, but after just a few months,
						the size on the MRI was increasing again. A second awake craniotomy
						was done in January 1999, removing all visible tumour and leaving
						me with a slight limp. Six weeks later, an MRI showed what appeared
						to be regrowth, which was confirmed by increased size on the next
						MRI and a sudden worsening of symptoms in late May.</p>
						<p>Two operations had failed, and radiation had failed twice, so
						we were left with chemotherapy, often ineffective in the brain.
						June and July I took high-dose methotrexate, an intensive in-patient
						protocol, but <img height="127" width="127" src="srsplanp.jpg" align="left">the tumour doubled in size. August and September I retried the
						high-dose EC that had worked in 1996. I knew I'd lose my hair
						(the 4th time) on chemo, but this time Pete decided to shave his
						head too. We had a party and required that everyone either shave
						their head or pay ten dollars, and we donated the money to cancer
						research. The tumour didn't respond<img height="125" width="125" src="90th.jpg" align="right"></p>
						<p>October 1999 I started Temodal, an experimental drug that hasn't
						been tested yet on breast cancer (even in the brain, it's still
						breast cancer). Two months later, another MRI. I was still feeling
						reasonably well, although incredibly tired. Comments my surgeon
						had made had left me with the idea that some of the mass might
						be dead tissue, and I asked for an experimental test that can
						distinguish tumour from necrosis, in the hope that things might
						not be as bad as they seemed. The day after the tests, I was told
						that the mass seemed to be smaller, which was the first good news
						in almost a year. Better <img height="125" width="125" src="hairp.jpg" align="left">news followed a week later, when the other test indicated that
						there was no living tumour detectable, that it was all necrosis.
						An expert in radiosurgery reviewed all of my 1999 MRIs, and said
						it was possibly necrosis all year, a textbook case of post-treatment
						damage.</p>
						<p>It was days before Christmas and Y2K celebrations, and I had gone
						from believing the tumour was<img height="127" width="127" src="globalp.jpg" align="right"> resistant to everything and I was going to die, to finding I
						was free of disease. Even my normally cautious oncologist was
						talking about the possibility of cure. It was a hard shift to
						make, even though the news was so good. I had almost lost hope,
						and had to relearn to dream. There were a lot of sleepless nights
						as my mind made the adjustment. The physical disabilities are
						still there. I have limited use of my right hand, a pronounced
						limp, and I can only walk a few blocks. I don't know how much
						will come back -- I want to play the harp again, to work with
						glass and metal, to race in the dragon boat, ride a bike. If I
						stay well, I'll <img height="127" width="127" src="goateep.jpg" align="left">have the time to relearn some of those things.</p>
						<p>I'm not able to work right now, and I miss it. I want to feel
						productive again. I have a pretty unusual collection of skills
						and experience in my <a href="cv/index.html">CV</a>, but without good dexterity, most of them are impossible. I learned
						to read Braille for fun when I was young, I taught myself the
						harp in my twenties, picked up some silversmithing, copper enamelling,
						calligraphy and art restoration, and while I've been sick I've
						developed computer skills, run a mailing list with Pete, and improved
						my computer graphics skills.
