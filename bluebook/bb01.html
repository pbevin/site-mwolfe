<h2><a name="001117morris"></a>Friday Nov 17 ­ Morris Wolfe</h2>
<p> I’m writing this in retrospect on Nov. 28. Had my last conversation with Menya 
  that afternoon ­ a conversation in which we both contributed equally. We talked 
  about mutual friends; about how good she felt about getting Pete back as husband, 
  lover and friend; about her nieces and nephews; about her illness; about our 
  own respective attitudes toward death and dying. As we talked we held hands. 
  Menya seemed relatively calm.</p>
<h2> <a name="001118morris"></a>Saturday Nov 18 ­ Morris Wolfe</h2>
<p> Brought some fruit from the market at around 1pm. Also slipper bed pan. (And 
  peameal bacon sandwiches for lunch). Menya was calm at first but when the subject 
  turned to her move downstairs, she became quite agitated about the number of 
  beds and poles and their location. Her talk was confused and confusing. She 
  and Pete became increasingly frustrated and eventually phoned Randi to see what 
  her understanding was. By this time, I’d slipped downstairs. When I went back 
  up, Menya was in tears and Pete was extremely discouraged. The only thing that 
  seemed clear was that Menya wanted to be in the same bed as Pete some of the 
  time.</p>
<h2> <a name="001119nancy"></a>Sunday Nov 19 ­ Nancy (Trinity)</h2>
<p> Menya seemed much less vigorous than she was last Sunday ­ rather worn out 
  (as was Pete). I played some music and massaged her feet and legs ­ and she 
  slept for most of the morning. When she woke up, we had a wee chat ­ Menya is 
  quite depressed and as she put it "feeling unloved." I asked her to give the 
  care team a chance to "care" for her in all senses of the word.</p>
<h2> <a name="001120randi"></a>Monday Nov 20 ­ Randi</h2>
<p> Menya confessed that she felt "patronized" by me (re: the weekend phone discussion 
  about the downstairs arrangements). I apologized. She’s especially sensitive 
  to not being "heard", because she has such a hard time expressing herself now. 
  Pete and I had to admit to each other that we don’t know how we’ll manage this 
  move downstairs. For sure, it will take careful planning… Because of a terrible 
  burning sensation, the VON removed the catheter today ­ it will be replaced 
  by tomorrow (hopefully). In the meantime, it’s diapers… Faye and I (and eventually 
  Ann Cox) got Menya into the bath. It was worth the (considerable) effort just 
  to see Menya’s relief and pleasure. We sang a few songs at the top of our lungs 
  ("Drunken Sailor" and "Today while the blossom" ­ Menya on harmonies). As I 
  write, Ann and Menya are giggling over reminiscences. That’s nice to hear. </p>
<h2><a name="001120ann"></a>Monday Nov 20 ­ Ann Cox</h2>
<p> Menya offered to let me stay for her therapeutic touch session with Heather, 
  which has been an education in awareness of someone else’s space. She seems 
  more settled now.</p>
<p> Over lunch, she talked about how easily words come for "frivolous topics" 
  but how exponentially more difficult it is to speak about emotionally charged 
  subjects. Says it’s very frustrating ­ the more important the topic or the stronger 
  her feelings are, the harder it is to speak. Feel like it’s a fine line between 
  helping out if she’s struggling but not automatically trying to finish sentences 
  for her.</p>
<p> Visited with Menya and Pete a bit ­ nice to hear that he hasn’t any idea what 
  happens tomorrow yet ­ "right now is fine" (i.e. no longer worried about the 
  schedule or who comes when). </p>
<h2><a name="001120roben"></a>Mon Nov 20 ­ Roben (Pottymouth) Goodfellow</h2>
<p> Menya didn’t seem to recognize my voice at first ­ so I swore, "Roben" says 
  she. We continue to exchange profanities and strange stories with the nurse 
  present ­ she seems in good humour about it J Menya expressed disdain for the 
  possibility of having to write out Christmas cards ­ we laugh.</p>
<h2><a name="001121randi"></a>Tue Nov 21 ­ Randi</h2>
<p> Although she woke up groggy and disoriented, which she said "sucks", Menya 
  has had a pretty good morning, relatively pain and nausea free. As I fed her 
  dry corn flakes and cut strawberries (her request) and kept losing the flakes 
  onto her front, she suggested that were I to look for another job at some point, 
  I shouldn’t put "feeder" on my resume. Oh well.</p>
<p> Menya frequently cannot find the right words to express what she wants, the 
  result being embarrassment and frustration on her part (and most likely the 
  caregiver’s). It helps to zero in on urgent physical needs:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Does she want to sit on the commode chair?</li>
  <li>Does she want the bed adjusted (usually ‘feet up’)?</li>
  <li> Does she want medication? Name them for her.</li>
</ul>
<p> Be patient and calm ­ keep your sense of humour, encourage Menya to take her 
  time ­ the more stressed out she gets, the harder it is for her to express herself.</p>
<h2> <a name="001121linda"></a>Tue Nov 21 ­ Linda Spiegel</h2>
<p> Pam Hammond called. I met Menya. I watched and helped over important procedures 
  (e.g. commode). Her reiki therapist arrived.</p>
<p> Mary Biedermann ­ therapeutic touch ­ called: give Menya her love.</p>
<p> Pleasant talking. A bit of laughter. A bit of tears… Getting to know each 
  other. The commode ­ a disaster, but we laughed a lot. Looking forward to next 
  week.</p>
