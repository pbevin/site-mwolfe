<h2><a name="001117morris"></a>Friday Nov 17 ­ Morris Wolfe</h2>
<p> I’m writing this in retrospect on Nov. 28. Had my last conversation with Menya 
  that afternoon ­ a conversation in which we both contributed equally. We talked 
  about mutual friends; about how good she felt about getting Pete back as husband, 
  lover and friend; about her nieces and nephews; about her illness; about our 
  own respective attitudes toward death and dying. As we talked we held hands. 
  Menya seemed relatively calm.</p>
<h2> <a name="001118morris"></a>Saturday Nov 18 ­ Morris Wolfe</h2>
<p> Brought some fruit from the market at around 1pm. Also slipper bed pan. (And 
  peameal bacon sandwiches for lunch). Menya was calm at first but when the subject 
  turned to her move downstairs, she became quite agitated about the number of 
  beds and poles and their location. Her talk was confused and confusing. She 
  and Pete became increasingly frustrated and eventually phoned Randi to see what 
  her understanding was. By this time, I’d slipped downstairs. When I went back 
  up, Menya was in tears and Pete was extremely discouraged. The only thing that 
  seemed clear was that Menya wanted to be in the same bed as Pete some of the 
  time.</p>
<h2> <a name="001119thh1"></a>Sunday Nov 19 ­ (Trinity)</h2>
<p> Menya seemed much less vigorous than she was last Sunday ­ rather worn out 
  (as was Pete). I played some music and massaged her feet and legs ­ and she 
  slept for most of the morning. When she woke up, we had a wee chat ­ Menya is 
  quite depressed and as she put it "feeling unloved." I asked her to give the 
  care team a chance to "care" for her in all senses of the word.</p>
<h2> <a name="001120randi"></a>Monday Nov 20 ­ Randi</h2>
<p> Menya confessed that she felt "patronized" by me (re: the weekend phone discussion 
  about the downstairs arrangements). I apologized. She’s especially sensitive 
  to not being "heard", because she has such a hard time expressing herself now. 
  Pete and I had to admit to each other that we don’t know how we’ll manage this 
  move downstairs. For sure, it will take careful planning… Because of a terrible 
  burning sensation, the VON removed the catheter today ­ it will be replaced 
  by tomorrow (hopefully). In the meantime, it’s diapers… Faye and I (and eventually 
  Ann Cox) got Menya into the bath. It was worth the (considerable) effort just 
  to see Menya’s relief and pleasure. We sang a few songs at the top of our lungs 
  ("Drunken Sailor" and "Today while the blossom" ­ Menya on harmonies). As I 
  write, Ann and Menya are giggling over reminiscences. That’s nice to hear. </p>
<h2><a name="001120ann"></a>Monday Nov 20 ­ Ann Cox</h2>
<p> Menya offered to let me stay for her therapeutic touch session with Heather, 
  which has been an education in awareness of someone else’s space. She seems 
  more settled now.</p>
<p> Over lunch, she talked about how easily words come for "frivolous topics" 
  but how exponentially more difficult it is to speak about emotionally charged 
  subjects. Says it’s very frustrating ­ the more important the topic or the stronger 
  her feelings are, the harder it is to speak. Feel like it’s a fine line between 
  helping out if she’s struggling but not automatically trying to finish sentences 
  for her.</p>
<p> Visited with Menya and Pete a bit ­ nice to hear that he hasn’t any idea what 
  happens tomorrow yet ­ "right now is fine" (i.e. no longer worried about the 
  schedule or who comes when). </p>
<h2><a name="001120roben"></a>Mon Nov 20 ­ Roben (Pottymouth) Goodfellow</h2>
<p> Menya didn't seem to recognize my voice at first ­ so I swore, "Roben" says 
  she. We continue to exchange profanities and strange stories with the nurse 
  present ­ she seems in good humour about it! Menya expressed disdain for the 
  possibility of having to write out Christmas cards ­ we laugh.</p>
<h2><a name="001121randi"></a>Tue Nov 21 ­ Randi</h2>
<p> Although she woke up groggy and disoriented, which she said "sucks", Menya 
  has had a pretty good morning, relatively pain and nausea free. As I fed her 
  dry corn flakes and cut strawberries (her request) and kept losing the flakes 
  onto her front, she suggested that were I to look for another job at some point, 
  I shouldn't put "feeder" on my resume. Oh well.</p>
<p> Menya frequently cannot find the right words to express what she wants, the 
  result being embarrassment and frustration on her part (and most likely the 
  caregiver's). It helps to zero in on urgent physical needs:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Does she want to sit on the commode chair?</li>
  <li>Does she want the bed adjusted (usually 'feet up')?</li>
  <li> Does she want medication? Name them for her.</li>
</ul>
<p> Be patient and calm ­ keep your sense of humour, encourage Menya to take her 
  time ­ the more stressed out she gets, the harder it is for her to express herself.</p>
<h2> <a name="001121thh3"></a>Tue Nov 21 ­ Trinity Home Hospice Volunteer #3</h2>
<p> Pam Hammond called. I met Menya. I watched and helped over important procedures 
  (e.g. commode). Her reiki therapist arrived.</p>
<p> Mary Biedermann ­ therapeutic touch ­ called: give Menya her love.</p>
<p> Pleasant talking. A bit of laughter. A bit of tears… Getting to know each 
  other. The commode ­ a disaster, but we laughed a lot. Looking forward to next 
  week.\</p>
<h2><a name="001123thh4"></a>Thu Nov 23 - Trinity Home Hospice Volunteer #4</h2>
<p>Right leg uncomfortable and took some time and medication to get it right. 
  Visit with sister Jen. Talked a bit about childhood. Listened to Menya's beautiful 
  harp playing and singing. Jen very affirming of Menya's talents and the way 
  in which she has dealth with the cancer.</p>
<h2><a name="001123jen"></a>Thu Nov 23 - Jen Wolfe</h2>
<p>A <b>lovely</b> evening. Menya in only slight discomfort. Visits from Kate 
  B, J. from THH, and VON nurse Pat (new). No tears, and very little frustration. 
  Menya was having trouble enunciating and finding words, but she paused and resumed 
  her thoughts with some success. Conversation with J. was peaceful, directed 
  by J. towards subjects such as Menya's childhood, music, and feelings abou diagnoses 
  and losing control. Great to just be here talking and stroking her hair. Drifted 
  to sleep to the sound of her own harp playing around 11:30pm.</p>
<p>I do notice her spatial sense is off, as mentioned above. She spent about ten 
  minutes groping around the bed before she slept. She removed all pillows and 
  blankets, and tried to put them on the cluttered bedside table. Then she kept 
  feeling around for the missing head pillow, grasping the saska pole and bed 
  controls, feeling around on the table to see what was where, and moving her 
  left leg from floor to bed and back and forth. She wasn't looking for anything 
  that she could name - just, I think, fixing its position in her mind.</p>
<p>Breathing is a little raspy but doesn't seem to bother her.</p>
<h2><a name="001124sue"></a>Fri Nov 24 - Sue Bridges</h2>
<p>A pleasant afternoon. Menya very groggy - semed to have much more trouble finding 
  words than the last time I saw her on Tuesday. However, she and I made ourselves 
  understood and we laughed over stories from one of Menya's books. Menya received 
  several other visitors while I was here, and drank a glass of chocolate milk 
  too. </p>
<h2><a name="001124roben"></a>Fri Nov 24 - Roben Goodfellow</h2>
<p>Ate a bit of spaghetti and one entire baked pear. Brian the wonder-nurse arrived 
  at about nine - very spiffy person. He, too, ate a pear. We listened to the 
  CDs Ross made for Menya of her earlier recording and Menya took great pleasure 
  in telling the tale of the original recording and its clean-up.</p>
<p>I am suddenly overwhelmed by an unexpected benefit of this project - I knew 
  that copies of the music would be a great thing for friends and family in future 
  years, but right now Menya is able to relive a happier time (well, more independent, 
  anyway). Yay! She made certain (at several points) that I would extend her thanks 
  to Ross.</p>
<p>Words came slowly, but we tried to be patient with one another. She spoke briefly 
  on the phone with her friend Lee and her sister Jen. Fell into a contented sleep 
  with Theo at 11pm. Let's see what happens next.</p>
<p>3am - became quite fitful, left side of her stomach seemed quite itchy. Applied 
  some gold balm and moved her over a bit, removed tape on catheter cord (well, 
  actually, she did that all by herself). We chatted a bit - I'd been concerned 
  about her harp music disturbing her sleep - way off base, slightly louder is 
  how she likes it.</p>
<h2><a name="001126thh1"></a>Sun Nov 26 - Trinity Home Hospice Volunteer #1</h2>
<p>I believe this is Meny'a first full day downstairs. Menya is with the world 
  where she wants to be. The nurse - Kathy - was here when I arrived - and Pete 
  was up - and looking much more rested, I must say. We helped Menya to sit up 
  so she would drink some hot chocolate. Took a bit to get her settled again - 
  lots of frustration with pillows, etc. - but finally helped her to get comfortable. 
  And then the homemaker came to give her a bath, etc. - so... had to get her 
  up again. Menya kept insisting on having a bath - although she was in the midst 
  of having a sponge bath. Increasingly frustrated, then agitated, and finally 
  just royally pissed off. I asked Pete to mediate - thank you Pete! - it seems 
  she wanted something to eat, not a bath... I gave Menya a foot massage to lullaby 
  music and she relaxed considerably and then insisted on giving me a back massage. 
  How could I refuse?</p>
<h2><a name="001126thh2"></a>Sun Nov 26 - Trinity Home Hospice Volunteer #2</h2>
<p>This is my first time meeting the family - the house was quite full today, 
  so Itried not to overtax Menya - offering personal care where needed and generally 
  gving both of us a chance to get to know each other. menya is clearly adjusted 
  to having her bed moved - the noises are different and it seems today there's 
  just a lot more stimulation for her.</p>
<p>* Her lips seem to be getting quite dry - is there a product we can get for 
  that? </p>
<p>Ben and I worked for quite a while trying to find a comfortable [position] 
  for the pillows - eventually I think we got there but Menya's frustration was 
  clear.</p>
<p>* It might be a good idea to get a draw sheet for the bed now, to help adjust 
  Menya in the bed.</p>
<h2><a name="001127randi"></a>Mon Nov 27 - Randi</h2>
<p>When I arrived this morning Menya was sitting on the floor with Dolores (the 
  overnight home maker) and Pete strategizing to lift her back into bed. Finally 
  the three of us managed to lift her into the bed - she lay there flopped at 
  right angle just to recover for a while. (She landed on the floor en route to 
  the commode - a logistical miscalculation). Eventually she was all straightened 
  out again.</p>
<p>Menya has requested that her pills - specifically the Dilaudid, Ativan and 
  Valium - be within her reach so she can take them herself (esp. in the night) 
  and not be so dependent on others. She wants some control, although I balked 
  a bit, concerned that she might be confused about what she was taking and when 
  she'd last taken it. I eventually taped something to the Ativan bottle so that 
  it is identifiable by touch.</p>
<p>The subject of the beds and mattresses seemed to tire and frustrate Menya. 
  Frustrated me too, because I can't (on't?) understand what it is exactly that 
  she wants.</p>
<p>I was feeling a bit crabby earlier - probably because I'm aready feeling some 
  back discomfort due to the un-hospital bed. I'm afraid I won't be able to hold 
  out physically without the aid of the adjustable bed for transfers etc. Guess 
  I'd better intensify my back strengthening routine.</p>
<h2><a name="001128thh3"></a>Tue Nov 28 - Trinity Home Hospice Volunteer #3</h2>
<p>Chatting - told her about my week...my fall. I gave her lunch, delicious smoked 
  salmon and bagels. She sat up in bed while I brushed her hair and wiped her 
  face with a wash cloth. I put some lipstick and blush on her. We laughed. I 
  read some poetry and she promptly fell asleep. </p>
<p>I stroked her arms and legs a bit. I think she loves it.</p>
<h2><a name="001129suem"></a>Wed Nov 29 - Sue Murray</h2>
<p>Came by yesterday and met Randi and Menya. Randi gave me a wonderful overview 
  of Menya's style of doing things. Was greeted by Theo and Pete when I arrived 
  this morning. Menya was sleeping soundly. Usual nursey stuff happened. Menya 
  and I chatted and she had a good lunch. Until next Wednesday!</p>
<h2><a name="001129pete"></a>Thu Nov 29 - Pete Bevin</h2>
<p>Theo died about 2 hours ago, hit by a car. Here are some random memories:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Theo was born in a beautiful thatched cottage in the U.K. When we adopted 
    him, the owners thought he was a girl - despite two furry balls betewen his 
    legs!</p>
  <p>When we got him home, Menya felt guilty - we had decided to get two cats, 
    and she didn't feel she could ever love another cat as much as she loved Theo.</p>
  <p>Theophilus - &quot;The Awful Puss&quot;. he was very dog-like: loyal, loving 
    to play fetch, flways following people around. And he loved licking his bum 
    at inopportune moments.</p>
  <p>It took him a while, but eventually he learned how to catch birds and mice. 
    One time he brought a half-dead bird in to show Menya during her reiki treatment. 
    Not appreciated.</p>
  <p>One day, Theo climbed the tree out front, higher than anyone had climbed 
    it before. Then he couldn't figure out how to get back down. He fell about 
    15 feet onto gravel, and walked away - unharmed - with a look that said &quot;I 
    meant to do that!&quot;</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.bestiary.com/cats/theo/">Theo's web page</a>(!) was mentioned 
    in the New York Times. They printed his email address, but he didn't get any 
    love letters from adoring females.</p>
  <p>He <i>loved</i> shrimp tails. We tried giving him the whole shrimp once, 
    but he couldn't figure out what the fleshy bit was for.</p>
  <p>Menya trained him to sit on command. He also figured out how to fish cat 
    treats out of the container with his paw. Luckily, he never worked out how 
    to open the lid - although he could hear it being opened from a long way off.</p>
  <p>After we saw The Lion King, we decided<br>
    Theo = Mufasa<br>
    Sputey = Simba<br>
    Dante = Scar</p>
  <p>Theo was very confident. A big part of it was that Menya staed home with 
    him when he was young. He always knew he was loved. Everyone in the neighbourhood 
    knew him, and he would often come into other people's houses for food and 
    affection.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="001130randi"></a>Thu Nov 30 - Randi</h2>
<p>I was shocked and deeply saddened to hear about Theo when I arrived this morning. 
  I had a good cry on Menya's shoulder. Hugs all around. Just the other day, I 
  asked Menya if she had a &quot;power animal&quot; or &quot;animal guide&quot; 
  (we were listening to Tamarra's CD - something witchy about ravens etc. - which 
  prompted me to ask the question) without missing a beat, menya said &quot;Theo&quot;. 
  Menya expressed to me this morning, through many tears, how sad and angry she 
  felt that Theo didn't get a proper funeral, and that she didn't get to say goodbye 
  - she couldn't seem to bear the thought of him just being carted off in a cardboard 
  box etc. (She expressed feelings of abandonment - adding that she felt abandoned 
  by me (all this through a fog) I think the changes - a new care team, the move 
  downstairs - have been very hard on her. I asked her if she identified with 
  Theo - yes she does. This has been an opportunity - an extremely painful one 
  - to express her grief and fear frustration about her own death.</p>
<p>I put on Mozart's Requiem and dedicated it to Theo. I'm not quite sure how 
  to do it, but I think it would be good to do some ritual around his passing 
  - very important.</p>
<p>Just read Pete's memories of Theo - so sweet. I assured Menya that Theo is 
  still her power animal and guide.</p>
<h2><a name="001130jennifer"></a>Thu Nov 30 - Jennifer Mason</h2>
<p>Wow...the move downstairs is accomplished. We chatted about various things 
  for a while and tol some silly jokes. Good to see Menya laugh a little. There 
  was such a peaceful feeling here when I arrived. Pete moved Menya to the big 
  bed after a while. After Pete went upstairs Menya and I talked quietly while 
  I massaged her feet. She had several moments of great distress at her inability 
  to make herself understood - the wrong words keep coming out. I laid in bed 
  beside her while she cried. I couldn't understand much, but she spoke about 
  waiting to die and not understanding why she was still here. I think it made 
  her feel a little better to express her frustration, even though I didn't &quot;get&quot; 
  it all. Then she perked up and I fed her some date square. We read a few chapters 
  of Harry Potter II, which she clearly enjoyed.</p>
<p>About 5:15 she became very restless and rang for Pete. It took a while to figure 
  out that what she wanted was some pain medication which we gave her, together 
  with some fruit. (a banana and an orange). When she tries to talk, frequently 
  the words that come out are the last ones she heard, not what she wants to say. 
  Pete is reading to her now.</p>
