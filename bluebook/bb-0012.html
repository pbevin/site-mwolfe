<h2><a name="001201sueb"></a>Friday Dec 1 - Sue Bridges</h2>
<p>Menya had a craving for chicken, so I cooked some up with mushroom sauce. She 
  often seems very concerned with my comfort and seeing that I have enough of 
  everything, and went on to express the ideat that perhaps we were all getting 
  tired of her. I said on the contrary that I wished I could do more, and she 
  shouldn't worry about any of us.</p>
<p>Heather came over and gave Menya a massage, after which she slept until 5:15pm. 
  She felt uncomfortable after she woke up, so she took two Tylenol.</p>
<h2>Friday Dec 1 - Roben Goodfellow</h2>
<p><i>6pm</i> She snores deeply and soundly. It's about 8pm. I arrived at 6pm 
  to a house of mirth, much gaiety and laughter. Menya was occasionally about 
  to get out the odd joke, proof positive that her wit is not dulled, even if 
  her speech is. She ate a bit of lassania (o damn, I have no idea how to spell 
  that!), wanted some drugs and some stories. I read a bit of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0062509373/keepingabreast">Dun 
  Cow</a> to her and she fell asleep.</p>
<p>So sad about Theo. Wed night she'd seemed pretty inconsolable, distressed and 
  particularly disoriented. It was only a few hours old. Last night she mentioned 
  to her brother Ben on the phone that it (Theo's death) would &quot;make the 
  funeral arrangements simpler.&quot; I think that she worried about how Theo 
  would take her passing.</p>
<p>I am convinced the Karma Fairy got the wrong bloody house.</p>
<p>Menya has just pulled the sheets up over her head in her sleep and the effect 
  is somewhat disconcerting. I hate to disturb her rest but I might just go adjust 
  that...</p>
<p>Passed the time now by dusting Menya's harps. House seems rather dry - might 
  ask permission later to set up a humidifier or vaporiser. Might just do it. 
  Larger harp seems dangerously dry, I will attend.</p>
<p>Nurse came by at about 9pm, Menya did not fully wake until the second round 
  of IV. Nurse's name was Cindy - she attended to Menya last year and remembers 
  her well.</p>
<p>Menya talked for a while, slowly and deliberately, not just about her sadness 
  for Theo's loss but for the accumulated loss. She listed her losses for me - 
  her ability to play music, to see, to get around, her independence, her breast, 
  hair and now her <u>CAT</u>. She states that Theo is the last straw. She says, 
  if there's nothing left to be done, and only loss - why is she still alive? 
  I tell her it's because she's too good at being alive, that she's lived more 
  in such a short time than many would in a century. She asks, what's the best 
  she can hope for then? I say, to not be in pain and to be surrounded by people 
  who love her - and since she is, in fact, surrounded by people who love her 
  who will give her pain killers that's pretty good, and more than some people 
  get. I ask if she understands how much she's loved - she says yes. She takes 
  particular delight in the emails she has received from total strangers - love 
  coming in from all points. And she understands that Pete loves her, although 
  she comments on his exhaustion. She is amazed by the strength of the relationship, 
  in fact, by his love for her. &quot;Four years and so much, and he's still here&quot; 
  she says. We begin to bante back and forth in darkly humorous ways. She tells 
  me a story I haven't heard before of someone in the SCA, an unassuming looking 
  king hanging out at a friend's house, debating the future of the kingship. &quot;You 
  wouldn't see that today&quot; she says. &quot;Lack of pretention.&quot; But 
  she is Queen here and can say whatever she likes. I try to cite other examples 
  of what is good about this time but it's such a stretch and such a minefield 
  of wrong things to say. So I settle on noting back at her what she has noted 
  to me before, that at this time she gets to see what her friends are made of. 
  I'd gotten (or rather, she had chosen - who could 'get' her to do anything she 
  didn't choose?) to agree that it wasn't a character flaw of some people not 
  to be able to be here, now, in this - some people just aren't built that way. 
  But for these left who wanted to help and did in whatever way we're able - she 
  really gets to see what we're made of. Quite frankly, I think we get to find 
  that out too.</p>
<p>Funny - I go to sleep, she fidgets. I'm up, and making no further noise than 
  I would sleeping and she's fine. Maybe I snore. Very fidgety aronud 5am - I 
  held her hand and she settled in. She tried to talk again but it wasn't working, 
  I told her to can it, that I'd heard it before. She grinned, fell back asleep 
  but would not release my hand for another 45 minutes. The pole is a handy thing 
  to lean on.</p>
<p><i>8am</i>: breakfast, bacon and tapioca.</p>
<h2>Saturday Dec 2 - Nancy</h2>
<p>A bright, brilliant sunny morning - but cold, which Menya wanted to hear about. 
  She obviously misses the world - seeing it, being a part of it. We had about 
  an hour together to talk - our quiet time before the nurse came. Menya talked 
  about &quot;too many losses, too much sorrow&quot; - and that she couldn't &quot;take 
  it any more.&quot; She talked about there no longer being &quot;hope,&quot; 
  and also about the loss of Theo - &quot;it seems such a silly thing&quot; she 
  said - I assured her it wasn't (having 2 cats myself). I didn't realise that 
  Theo had been killed - and so spent some time reassuring Menya about Theo coming 
  back. When I talked to Pete, he told me the sad news. I feel a right idiot, 
  I do. Lesson: always read the log book before starting a shift. Anyway, we helped 
  Menya to sit up - she was in considerable pain - in her hips, I believe. Gave 
  her some Tylenol and she dozed somewhat in a sitting position. Once we helped 
  her lie down in the hospital bed, she decided hat she wanted to &quot;see&quot; 
  the world. So we moved her to the big bed, drew back the drapes and I described 
  the world - right down to the woman with the shocking turquoise hair across 
  the street! Menya's dad has arrived - with lunch. So I will be on my way. Until 
  next Sunday then...</p>
<h2>Sunday Dec 3 - Kay</h2>
<p>Menya was a little upset today. Apparently she had a misunderstanding with 
  the nurse this morning that Menya didn't realize <i>was</i> a misunderstanding 
  on her part until after the nurse left. I rtied to let her know that even if 
  the nurse didn't understand the specifics, that she would also realize that 
  it was a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Visits by Ian and Carla.</p>
<p>Menya resting as I slip away at the end of my shift as quietly as possible!</p>
<h2>Tuesday Dec 5 - Linda Spiegel</h2>
<p>When I arrived Menya was sitting up and we chatted. I told her some events 
  that happened to me this week, as well as a few serious events that had happened 
  to me in my life. She was very responsive and eager to listen. She wanted to 
  sit and stand frequently. I finally settled her down and she agreed. I read 
  her a short story by I.B.Singh. We got to the last paragraph and she lost concentration. 
  Now sitting on the commode with Pete talking to her. Cake and juice is waiting.</p>
<h2>Tuesday Dec 5 - Pete Bevin</h2>
<p>Menya has been very confused the last couple of days. It's <i>very</i> hard 
  to understand her. Reading is good for her, as is touching/stroking. Often needs 
  reassurance that we aren't lying to he.</p>
<h2>Wednesday Dec 6 - Sue Murray</h2>
<p>Arrived to find Menya up on the commode and Pete getting ready for the day. 
  After Pete rescued us from a singularly unsuccessful transfer, Menya settled, 
  took some Valium and Ativan, and slept soundly.</p>
<h2>Thursday Dec 7 - Jennifer Mason</h2>
<p>Menya had a difficult afternoon, but a very busy one. She was in good spirits 
  when I arrived, but became quite disoriented, getting up and down. Quite difficult 
  to understand her and she is frustrated. Her mom (Carla) visited and I went 
  upstairs so they would have some privacy. Then Dr John [Blondal] and Grace came. 
  Menya is clearly worried about &quot;being too much trouble&quot;. We all assured 
  her she is not. Kate has just arrived. </p>
<h2>Friday Dec 8 - Randi</h2>
<p>Menya a little sad and troubled at first - telling us she wants to trust us 
  but it is hard. However, as the morning progressed she was calm, quiet, even 
  chuckling and laughing at times. Sherry came at 8:30am for a brief training 
  session. And we had a new nurse - Cindy - who required supervision from the 
  old pro Pete (he donned his nurse's cap again - fetching!) Sue Bridges had to 
  cancel this afternoon. Liz Calderhead from next door graciously, and readily, 
  agreed to come over until Pete comes home.</p>
<p>Sunday Dec 10 - Nancy</p>
<p>I arrived bright and early this morning to two sleeping beauties! Menya appeared 
  to be in some discomfort - generally all over. She wanted to get up, but I had 
  a devil of a time helping her to sit up. Had to ask for Pete's help (sorry Pete) 
  because it was impossible otherwise. Candace (nurse) gave Menya a scrub this 
  morning and she sat up for a little while in the chair. I gave her some waffles 
  for breakfast (yum!) This is my first visit in which Menya and I haven't talked 
  the whole time - definitely a new experience. She gets so frustrated trying 
  to speak and make herself understood - rather heart-breaking to see. Anyway, 
  very quiet morning - unlike other Sunday mornings when there has been a lot 
  of activity. Menya seems much more tired and weaker this week. However, about 
  half an hour ago, she seemed quite emotional, angry, sad. I told her how truly 
  and well loved she is - but she said she wasn't feeling very lovable. I tried 
  to reassure her that indeed she was, even when she's angry and demanding and 
  sad. Not sure if this went in at all.</p>
<h2>Sunday Dec 10 - Kay</h2>
<p>Menya began sleeping shortly after the changeover with Nancy. Margaret visiting.</p>
<p> Menya still sleeping peacefully. A quiet, restful afternoon. Pete gave the 
  cat got a good work!</p>
