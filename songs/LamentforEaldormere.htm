  <font face="Verdana" size="5" color="#FF0000">Lament for Ealdormere<br>
  </font><font face="Verdana"><font size="2"><b>Spring 1986<br>
  The Region of Ealdormere was outlawed by HRM Alen in February, and people 
  responded in many different ways. Baron Aeden wrote a story about Ealdormere 
  as a female warrior created by the people and brought down by the fates, who 
  were jealous because they had not foretold her birth. It helped to make a lot 
  of negative energy positive and eased some of the anger. This song is very 
  close to his story, but omits the hopeful ending to preserve the feel of a 
  lament.<br>
  <br>
  </b></font>Well may you weep, you maidens merry<br>
  Well may you weep, you warriors bold<br>
  Men by the fire and mothers nursing<br>
  Sad news I tell, Ealdormere is dead<br>
  <br>
  She was not born of man or woman<br>
  She was not sent by gods above<br>
  She was the sum of all our hearts yearning<br>
  Bitter words, Ealdormere is dead<br>
  <br>
  Strong she was as stones beneath us<br>
  Soft as the earth at planting time<br>
  Fair she was as the hearth in the winter<br>
  Spent her flame, Ealdormere is dead<br>
  <br>
  Blessed by beast of field and forest<br>
  Blessed by all but destiny<br>
  Fates are not kind to those who defy them<br>
  Black their gifts, Ealdormere is dead<br>
  <br>
  Wondrous her works yet none might outlast her<br>
  Sure her shafts, too many the foe<br>
  Countless her friends, yet none might stand by her<br>
  Lone she fell, Ealdormere is dead<br>
  <br>
  Tell your sons and tell your daughters<br>
  Tell your babes this tale of woe<br>
  A hero was born but the world was not ready<br>
  Brief her song, Ealdormere is dead</font></p>
