  </font><font face="Verdana"><font size="2"><b>Winter, 1993<br>
  Mereddin and Menya agreed when they met for the second time in 1992 to write a 
  song about each other, since they'd both written many songs but never been the 
  subject of one. Menya presented this to him the next time they met, almost two 
  years later. It seems cryptic, but is based on his personna history and the 
  peculiar bardic bond they share.<br>
  <br>
  </b></font>Mereddin, dark raven, grey storm clouds are brewing<br>
  Fly high on the wind in the still of the night<br>
  Though dark shadows haunt you, your goddess is with you<br>
  Fly swiftly, Mereddin, beloved, to me<br>
  <br>
  Oh once you were handsome, with rainment of silver<br>
  A joy to the ladies, the ruler of men<br>
  But then came your calling, and came your downfalling<br>
  Fly bravely, Mereddin, beloved, to me<br>
  <br>
  Oh men call you evil one, doomslayer, kinslayer<br>
  Fear not their hatred, and hate not their fear<br>
  Their barbs cannot reach you while darkness enfolds you<br>
  Fly freely, Mereddin, beloved, to me<br>
  <br>
  No mortal can fathom keen sorrow of prophets<br>
  To know each man's fate when you look in his eyes<br>
  To gaze in the Tarn and see your own dying<br>
  Fly softly, Mereddin, beloved, to me<br>
  <br>
  The head of Thorvaldr you carried before you<br>
  A dark bird of carrion with blood on your wings<br>
  Let no mortal judge you, unless he be blameless<br>
  Fly freely, Mereddin, beloved, to me<br>
  <br>
  Mereddin, dark raven, I long to go with you<br>
  To share joys and sorrows and walk by your side<br>
  But your dark wings take where I cannot follow<br>
  Fly swiftly, Mereddin, beloved, to me</font></p>
