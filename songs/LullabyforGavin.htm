  </font><font face="Verdana"><font size="2"><b>Winter, 1984<br>
  Gavin's was an unexpected arrival, and Eoforwic quickly organized a baby 
  shower for Sir Finnvar and Lady Ragni. My gift was this song, written in 
  haste. The most memorable gift was a wooden toy made by Tarver, a figure with 
  moving arms and legs.<br>
  <br>
  </b></font>Sleep in my arms, my bonny wee babe<br>
  And dream of sweetness and song.<br>
  You're the son of a knight and a lady bright,<br>
  And they'll watch over you all night long.<br>
  <br>
  When you're a lad, you'll play like a prince<br>
  With trinkets of silver and gold,<br>
  With horses and hounds and hawks all around,<br>
  And picture books fair to behold.<br>
  <br>
  When you're a man, all bearded and brave,<br>
  And fighting with heater and sword, <br>
  The fairest of maids from village and glade<br>
  Will love you and make you her lord.<br>
  <br>
  Sleep in my arms, my bonny wee babe<br>
  And dream of sweetness and song.<br>
  You're the son of a knight and a lady bright,<br>
  And they'll watch over you all night long.<br>
