  </font><font face="Verdana"><font size="2"><b>Spring 1984<br>
  This was written for a pagan couple who were married, and has since become a 
  favourite in that community. Menya always liked riddle songs, especially the 
  ones where the man really just wants to have his way and the woman is testing 
  him.<br>
  <br>
  </b></font>Woman: I'll sing you a riddle of water and earth, <br>
  Who was the mother that gave us all birth?<br>
  Who cradles and comforts and nurses us still, <br>
  Answer me my love<br>
  <br>
  Man: I'll sing you the answer with copper and bone, <br>
  She dwells in the fountain and also the stone.<br>
  The lady's our mother, the day it is done,<br>
  Come to me my love.<br>
  <br>
  Woman: I'll sing you a riddle of fire and air,<br>
  Who is the father that keeps us from care?<br>
  Who stands as a guardian when danger is near, <br>
  Answer me my love.<br>
  <br>
  Man: I'll sing you the answer with morning and night,<br>
  His voice is the thunder, his smile the light.<br>
  The Lord is our father, the day it is done,<br>
  Come to me my love.<br>
  <br>
  Woman: I'll sing you a riddle of chalice and sword,<br>
  What can be greater than Lady or Lord?<br>
  What was the beginning of all living things,<br>
  Answer me my love.<br>
  <br>
  Man: I'll sing you the answer with bitter and sweet,<br>
  The world was created when these two did meet.<br>
  Their union is greater, the day it is done,<br>
  Come to me my love.<br>
  <br>
  Woman: I'll sing you a riddle of legend and lore.<br>
  How long will this union of unions endure?<br>
  How long will it last, and when will it end?<br>
  Answer me my love.<br>
  <br>
  Man: I'll sing you the answer with myrtle and rue, <br>
  It cannot last longer than my love for you.<br>
  The answer's forever, the day it is done,<br>
  Come to me my love.<br>
  <br>
  Both: Come to me my love.<br>
  Come to me my love.</font></p>
