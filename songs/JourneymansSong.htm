  </font><font face="Verdana"><font size="2"><b>Summer 1993<br>
  Tamarra released two female apprentices one Pennsic because they were both 
  marrying and moving&nbsp; far away. She asked Menya (three days beforehand) to 
  write a song for the occasion. The term journeyman comes from journee, not 
  journey (journeymen were paid by the day),&nbsp; but Menya thought the song 
  worked.<br>
  <br>
  </b></font>Chorus: <br>
  Journey on, journeyman, journey on<br>
  May the wind be always at your back<br>
  May the gods guide your footsteps and your road lead you home<br>
  Journey on, journeyman, journey on<br>
  <br>
  Verse: <br>
  I have loved you like a mother<br>
  And I've watched the seasons change you<br>
  But you've grown into a woman<br>
  And it's time that you were leaving<br>
  <br>
  Chorus<br>
  <br>
  I have loved you like a sister<br>
  And I've shared your joys and sorrows<br>
  Now your heart has found another<br>
  And it's time that you were leaving<br>
  <br>
  Chorus<br>
  <br>
  I have loved you like a teacher<br>
  And I've shared with you my knowledge<br>
  But the world will teach you wisdom<br>
  And it's time that you were leaving<br>
  <br>
  Chorus<br>
  <br>
  Oh, leavetaking is a sorrow<br>
  But my heart is filled with laughter<br>
  For your road lies straight before you<br>
  And I know that you will prosper<br>
  <br>
  Chorus with last line repeated</font></p>
