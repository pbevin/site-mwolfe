  </font><font face="Verdana"><font size="2"><b>Winter 1986<br>
  Michael was a member of the SCA for about a year before he took his own life. 
  He had shown no signs of depression, but suffered from terrible migraines that 
  caused him to black out and lose blocks of memory. It is believed that it was 
  during an attack one night that he became irrational and hanged himself in his 
  bedroom in an effort to stop the unbearable pain.<br>
  </b></font><br>
  Where are you going, you wanderer weary?<br>
  Where are you going this cold moonless night?<br>
  Where are you going with your cheeks pale as lilies?<br>
  You cannot get far in the pale candlelight<br>
  <br>
  The sunlight has faded, your burden is heavy<br>
  The path you have chosen is narrow and long<br>
  Wait 'til tomorrow, and I will go with you <br>
  By daylight we'll choose the road we'll walk along<br>
  <br>
  Remember the Spring in the depths of the Winter<br>
  Remember the dawn in the dark of the night<br>
  Remember the sound of your own merry laughter<br>
  Remember your dreams when you wake in the night<br>
  <br>
  (instrumental)<br>
  <br>
  Where were you going you wanderer weary?<br>
  Where were you going that cold moonless night?<br>
  Far from the daylight my song cannot reach you<br>
  Did you find what you sought in the still of the night?</font></p>
