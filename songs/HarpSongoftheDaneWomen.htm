  <font face="Verdana" size="5" color="#FF0000">Harp Song of the Dane Women<br>
  </font><font face="Verdana"><font size="2"><b>Words by Rudyard Kipling<br>
  Music by Rhiannon<br>
  <br>
  NOTE: The music for this song has been lost. If anyone knows the tune that 
  Menya wrote for this piece (or any other music not listed at this site), 
  please contact Robert Schweitzer <a href="mailto:(tablet@interlog.com">
  (tablet@interlog.com</a>)<br>
  <br>
  A great Kipling poem that deserved a melody so it could be played on or with 
  the harp. Menya has written music for other pieces of poetry as well, but none 
  she could easily find.<br>

  </b></font>What is a woman that you forsake her<br>
  and the hearth fire, and the home-acre<br>
  to go with the old, grey Widow-Maker?<br>
  <br>
  She has no house to lay a guest in<br>
  but one chill bed for all to rest in<br>
  that the pale suns and the stray bergs nest in<br>
  <br>
  She has no strong white arms to fold you <br>
  but the ten times fingering weeds to hold you<br>
  out on the rocks where the tide has rolled you<br>
  <br>
  Yet, when the signs of Summer thicken<br>
  and the ice breaks and the birch-buds quicken<br>
  yearly you turn from our side and sicken<br>
  <br>
  Sicken again for the shouts and the slaughters<br>
  you steal away to the lapping waters<br>
  and look at your ship in her winter quarters<br>
  <br>
  You forget our mirth, and talk at the tables<br>
  the kine in the shed and the horse in the stables<br>
  to pitch her sides and go over her cables...<br>
  <br>
  Then you drive out where the storm clouds swallow<br>
  and the sound of your oar-blades, falling hollow<br>
  is all we have left through the months to follow<br>
  <br>
  Ah...but what is a woman that you forsake her<br>
  and the hearth fire, and the home-acre<br>
  to go with the old, grey Widow-Maker?</font></p>
