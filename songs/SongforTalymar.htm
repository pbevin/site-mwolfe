  theme)<br>
  </font><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Summer</font></b><font face="Verdana"><font size="2"><b>, 
  1987<br>
  </b></font><br>
  What can I find for to give to my lady<br>
  A token to show her my faith and my love<br>
  Her strength is her beauty, her beauty unceasing<br>
  She's the love of my life, and I live in her love<br>
  <br>
  Gold has a glimmer that's ever unchanging<br>
  Silver is secret and silent of hue<br>
  but for all their great value, they cannot buy happiness<br>
  They're as cold as the clay when the summer is through<br>
  <br>
  The finest of rubies, the fairest of emeralds, <br>
  The greatest and roundest of pearls I could bring<br>
  but her beauty lacks nothing, no gem can surpass her<br>
  And when they adorn her their sparkle grows dim<br>
  <br>
  (theme for Eislinn once alone, then played with next verse)<br>
  <br>
  If I could reach up to the sun in the heavens<br>
  I'd slow down his course for a moment or two<br>
  For the days pass too quickly, the nights have no mercy<br>
  A wink of an eye and a season is through<br>
  <br>
  If days grew like flowers, I'd gather her ten thousand<br>
  And still I would weep that I'd brought her no more<br>
  For each fragrant petal, each moment together<br>
  Is worth more by far than the ransom of kings<br>
  <br>
  (Eislinn's theme and variations)<br>
  <br>
  I'll win her a kingdom, I'll conquer an empire<br>
  I'll throne her with honour and crown her with fame<br>
  And if all the world should resolve into nothing<br>
  Still the stars in the heavens will echo her name<br>
  <br>
  (Eislinn's theme, fading out)</font></p>

  <font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Eislinn suffered from breast cancer, the same 
  disease as Menya. When Talymar won the Midrealm crown a second time,<br>
  it was hoped she was cured, but she recurred while they were still heirs. At 
  her insistence, they carried on with the reign,<br>
  which was one of the most glorious in Midrealm history. She was undergoing 
  chemotherapy and radiation treatments <br>
  even during Pennsic. Everyone understood by that point that her disease was 
  likely terminal, and many songs were written <br>
  and gifts given. Menya wrote this for Talymar, since she knew him fairly well, 
  but barely knew Eislinn, and because she sensed <br>
  his frustration at being unable to prevent the inevitable. He liked it because 
  it wasn't depressing like so many others.<br>
  <br>
  When she was diagnosed in April of 1996, Menya dealt with it in part by 
  playing the harp for hours every day. <br>
  She played this song a lot.</b></font></p>
