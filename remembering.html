            of years ago. I got to stay with Menya. It was when she taught me 
            calligraphy, because I had always admired hers so much. I still 
            practice it. I also remember persuading Menya to teach me "the" song 
            - the one I always used to bug her to sing for me. I think she 
            finally gave in just so she wouldn't have to sing it

          <TD vAlign=top width="95%" colSpan=2>God, where to begin... I guess 
            I could start with her jokes. She could always say the cheekiest 
            things with a totally straight face (I remember her making an entire 
            room collapse once by singing the folk song line "he stands at the 
            corner, a fag in his mouth..." without actually doing anything to 
            highlight the double-entendre). Or her retelling of the time when 
            she had started busking "Gold is the colour of my true love's hair" 
            just as, by total coincidence, a woman with blue hair walked by (in 
            her words: "...and I thought...'nah'..."). And then there was the 
            time in the SCA when she was running for mayor of Ealdormere, and 
            walked up to me before the meeting and uttered the words "If you'll 
            vote for me, I'll make you city ratcatcher." How could I 
        refuse?</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR>

            of Ealdormere. I wish I could take credit for more of the fun, but 
            the most creative doings were always her inventions. I remember her 
            angelic look of innocence that had been honed in mischievous moments 
            over and over again: pinching the bums of kings and princes, biting 
            knees under the head of high table one memorable tourney in St. 
            Catherine's, spreading mud all over the pristine white shirt of a 
            peacocky friend after building a working brick and mud oven one

            memories: <BR><BR>It was Pennsic 19, at dusk. The torches were lit, 
            the campfires were burning about camp and above the buzz of 
            conversation and passing people on the way, I heard harp music 
            coming from up the hill. I stepped out of my pavilion and made my 
            way towards the music. And there she was; seated outside Tammara and 
            Richard's pavilion, playing. I sat down. I listened. And I stayed 
            until she was finished, and then some.<BR><BR>And that's how I want 
            to remember her; in the torchlight, with the smell of woodsmoke in 
            the air and the muted sounds of Pennsic in the background, playing 
            her harp and singing.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR>

          <TD vAlign=top width="95%" colSpan=2>I will never forget my first 
            Belane in the Park after I joined the Craft. The night was mild and 
            magical. There were mosquitoes, and consequently bats flitting 
            about. As I entered the grove, I saw this beautiful woman playing 
            the harp. She looked like a Boticelli Madonna,with her long hair and 
            gorgeous huge eyes. We never exchanged many words over the years, 
            but I felt a strong kinship with her when I learned of her brain 
            tumour (I had been Dx'd with a brain tumour-fortunately a 
            misdiagnosis-when I was 25)&gt; I continued to feel a kinship as my 
            own illness progresses. We miss the same things, walking, running, 
            dancing, riding a bike, playing an instrument… Though we were 
            scarcely more than acquaintances, I always felt that Menya was a 
            sister under the skin. She touched my life, and I will miss 
        her.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR>

            that I feel strongly too. I didn't get to spend time with Menya on 
            that many occasions, if I count them up, but she did seem like a 
            much-loved sister to me. Also her sense of humour was wonderful, and 
            the grin to go with it.<BR><BR>On one occasion we were chatting and 
            Menya asked what my middle name was, and I said I didn't have one. 
            Menya thought about it, and decided on a middle name she thought 
            would suit me. I'm not sure what spelling she had in mind, but 
            anyway, as of this week, I am Sharon <I>Anne</I> 
            Curtis.<BR><BR>Menya, I'm going to miss you a lot. But at least 
            anytime I look at something with my full name on, I'll have a 
            reminder of you right there. Thank you.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR>

            hold our own little wake once Wendy is well again, and I still have 
            a tape of songs that Menya recorded for me about 7 or 8 years ago 
            now. It's going to be really hard listening to that knowing that she 
            is now gone.<BR><BR>While things didn't work out between us, there 
            were still<BR>some good times, and she did me a lot of good in 
            bringing<BR>me out of myself and showing me that someone could love 
            me.<BR>So for me Menya's greatest legacy is giving me 
            myself.<BR><BR>Perhaps one of my favourite memories, though, is 
            canoeing<BR>in Algonquin Park. We almost left our tent on the 
            quayside.<BR>We saw the most amazing star filled sky I will ever

            hummingbird,<BR>and met the maddest French people I will ever 
            encounter.<BR>That was a very special time.<BR><BR>One of the other 
            special times was helping out at stuff<BR>during the Viking festival 
            in York, and it is very poignant<BR>that the height of the festival 
            is this weekend.<BR><BR>More than anything I am glad she found Pete. 
            He<BR>has been such a rock, and frankly an inspiration to 
            the<BR>rest of us as well. He did more than I could ever

          <TD vAlign=top width="95%" colSpan=2>I'm finding it very difficult 
            to write about my feelings for Menya. I truly believe that without 
            her caring and wisdom I would not have lived very long at all. It's 
            been just over 3 years since I was told that I had 
            cancer.<BR><BR>Like Menya, I have Inflammatory Breast Cancer 
            (IBC)<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Healthy people have no idea how freaky it feels 
            being told one has a rare and potentially lethal disease. The IBC 
            web site and support list Pete and Menya started has literally been 
            a life saver for people all over the world with IBC. Comments come 
            in all the time from list members saying that they wouldn't have 
            been able to cope if it wasn't for the connections they have been 
            able to make with other IBC people through the support 
            list.<BR><BR>Not many people know the terror we feel knowing that we 
            have IBC. One feels SO alone and it's of great comfort to finally 
            find a place where there are others on the same path who understand 
            the journey.<BR><BR>Menya and I talked often on the phone and I had 
            the pleasure of actually meeting her and Pete twice. Once when they 
            traveled to Ottawa and once when I was passing through Toronto on 
            the way to visit my daughter. I'll miss her crazy laughter. Her 
            incredible wit and wisdom will astound me forever. Those who knew 
            her personally will understand my feelings of loss. Those who only 
            knew her through cyber space will also understand. She touched us 
            all. She had a heart so big.<BR><BR>She loved Pete with a passion 
            and once told me that she was the luckiest woman on earth to have 
            him for a soul mate.<BR>I wish Pete the strength to cope with the 
            loss of Menya. If it's of any help, there are hundreds of other 
            people from the IBC support list who feel the same.<BR><BR>At a 
            later date, when my heart is a little less sore, I will try to write 
            some of the silly memories I have of Menya. We laughed together 
            often.<BR><BR>Lee Smith<BR>Ottawa</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR>

            Monica greeted me when I arrived at the SCA meeting that fall of 
            1983 - a couple of giddy girls you seemed to my oh-so-sophisticated 
            graduate student self. I remember the Alice-in-Wonderland-dress and 
            the closet party and extinguishing the Eternal Flame and many other 
            wild adventures. You always will be that impish, wild, dangerous 
            girl when I think of you.<BR><BR>I remember well sharing music with 
            you - the Soldiers Three rehearsing in my room, or at the Pagan 
            Palace, or just singing and playing together for the companionship 
            of it. Though we often sang of drink and debauchery, I think you 
            always loved the melancholy songs best, the laments and the dirges, 
            the ballads of loss and sacrifice. You will always be that singer 
            with sad eyes when I think of you.<BR><BR>I remember well sharing 
            joy with you. You were the catalyst that brought my life and 
            Monica's life together. Although we were going different ways when 
            first we met, it was your constant friendship that kept bringing us 
            together so that our own love could grow. You stood with us at our 
            wedding, sharing the solemn and happy moment with us. And you still 
            were the imp, who wormed out the secret get-away we had thought was 
            totally secure. You will always be that laughing friend, 
            co-conspirator and constant helper, when I think of you. <BR><BR>I 
            remember well sharing trouble with you. When our son Michael was 
            born and we had to learn to accept his disability, you were always 
            there. You were there despite the thousands of miles that separated 
            us, and you would call just to let us talk to you, to voice our 
            fears, to help us carry our burden for a short time. And I remember 
            when you called to share your burden with us, how you told us of 
            your cancer and how suddenly we realized that we really had no 
            burden at all. You will always be that generous caring sister when I 
            think of you.<BR><BR>Menya, you lived with courage and dignity, with 
            laughter and tears, with love, with generosity, and ultimately with 
            acceptance. All these things you shared with us, and we are the 
            richer for it.<BR>Menya, you were and are and will be the best of 
            friends. <BR><BR>I will miss you.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR>

          <TD vAlign=top width="95%" colSpan=2><BR>Brother Bill and I visited 
            Menya at St. Mike's after a surgery there. Bill had left to pick up 
            the Thai food and I was wheeling Menya around for some hospital 
            "fresh air". We found, after what seemed like ages of asking staff 
            who curiously didn't know where to direct us, the Chapel. In the 
            Chapel, Menya sang. I had not heard her sing before. From Menya's 
            lips came the most angelic sounds. The ease with which the tones 
            came, and their beauty..... They filled the room and my heart. 
            Afterwards, Pete and Bill played some very cute and entertaining 
            game of peek-a-boo with an ancient statue in a 
        foyer....</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR>

          <TD vAlign=top width="95%" colSpan=2>There's obviously not enough 
            room here to say everything I want to say about Menya and Pete. So I 
            will say this. It was fate that intervened through a very unusual 
            series of circumstances that put me into Pete and Menya's world. I 
            know they each felt very lucky to have each other. I feel doubly 
            lucky to have known them both. <BR><BR>Menya has left for me an 
            incredible gift. The gift of ultimate courage. No matter how 
            dreadful or tedious the day I'm having, I have only to think of what 
            Menya went through and how she handled her circumstances with such 
            grace and dignity and positive action. Somehow, my day automatically 
            gets better, especially when I recall the supercilious eyebrow that 
            she could arch so well or the wicked laugh and rapier wit with which 
            she used so effectively so often.<BR><BR>I will always treasure the 
            quiet talks she and I had, about a wide range of subjects, from drug 
            treatments to Shakespeare to religious morality, and I will always 
            marvel at both she and Pete's ultimate courage in being able to ask 
            their friends for help. It takes special people to be able to do 
            this, and I was honoured to be allowed into their lives, in both 
            good times and bad. To my soeur de saucisson, the Beatrice to my 
            Benedict, I salute you, Menya----player of bridge and harp, lover of 
            chocolate, and now, guardian angel. Keep the fires of Valhalla warm 
            for the rest of us, for if ever anyone deserved to be in the hall of 
            heroes, it is certainly you.<BR><BR>With all my

          <TD vAlign=top width="95%" colSpan=2>I spent a lot of time with 
            Menya over the years. As a child, we visited frequently. As a 
            pre-teen, she designed some seriously strange store windows for me. 
            As a teenager, she was there to welcome me when I came home with my 
            new baby. She was planning to "run" things for me while I coped with 
            the little one. IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. I cooked and scrubbed and 
            laundered. Menya cuddled. She sang spontaneous little baby songs and 
            the bond was formed. In the years that followed, Menya came to our 
            summer house with us, was child-tender extraordinaire, "keeper of 
            the canoe key", resident artist, as well as inventor of rainy day 
            games and strange kitchen concoctions. It was a delight to know I 
            could just goof off because I didn't worry too much about cooking or 
            scrubbing or laundry there. We just laughed and did very weird 
            things -- an activity which suited her admirably.. She used to start 
            those summer mornings with the ritual greeting of "Hello Ant" and 
            insisted that I reply "Hello Nice". She had a high opinion of 
            herself even then!<BR><BR>Watching her grow up was a pleasure. Her 
            interests were so varied that she didn't seem to have any focus -- 
            just a scattergun approach to life. Then one day everything clicked 
            and came together and I think she rolled every funny little skill 
            she had into one career. What a way to go through life -- be crazy 
            and manage to make it work!<BR><BR>I'm sure going to miss you, kid 
            -- and your wisecracks about all my musical shortcomings. Thank you 
            for leaving a little of yourself with everyone who knew you -- and 
            for the free babysitting all those years 
  ago.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR>

          <TD vAlign=top width="95%" colSpan=2>I met Menya in High School at 
            Northern Secondary. She was a grade behind me but we were in the 
            same choir class. An imp back then, she drove the music teacher 
            crazy one April's Fools Day by taking all his white chalk and 
            replacing it with coloured chalk, changing the colours throughout 
            the day. She also wrapped the piano like a present.<BR><BR>She 
            joined the SCA soon after I had, and we spent a lot of time singing 
            together. In those early days, people sometimes confused our names, 
            (just call us Menica and Monya), but that didn't last too long as 
            she soon earned a place for herself. <BR><BR>I recall her mooning 
            over a harp in the window of Remenyi Music, then making that trip to 
            Ottawa to build her first harp with Naon. I remember her early 
            attempt to drive during an SCA trip to Waterloo. I remember her 
            pranks, slumber parties in her residence room, camping at Pennsic, 
            singing and playing with Soldier's Three, and many interesting 
            conversations as Phil and I courted, ("Life is a Shakespearean 
            Comedy"). <BR><BR>Menya, I am sorry we had to live so far away these 
            last years. I am glad you found such a loving and caring husband in 
            Pete. I am glad I did see you last fall, where despite your illness, 
            you still maintained your wry sense of humour. I shall miss

            and I was always trying to get copies of her music. Unfortunately, 
            she decided that her personna was illiterate, and would only teach 
            the music by rote (which doesn't work well when you live in a 
            different city). In the last year, having finally obtained copies of 
            her lyrics, I was working with her to transcribe the actual music.

            described as "two dimensional", some as "three dimensional". 
            Describing Menya as "three dimensional" just doesn't do her justice 
            - she was "n dimensional". There are just so many different sides to 
            her character, roles that she played, different contexts that she 
            was comfortable in. It really needs a bulletin board like this where 
            the many of us can contribute our pieces of the overall mosaic. And 
            we still won't do her justice.<BR><BR>I knew her for about twenty 
            years. Sometimes we were closer, some times we were further apart. 
            We shared an apartment for a while. And years went by (or seemed to) 
            when we didn't see each other. In those twenty years there were a 
            few sides of her that I saw, others that I know of but never 
            experienced personally. It's hard to pick out which stories to 
            tell.<BR><BR>I met Menya in the SCA. She had a lot of friends there. 
            Many in high places - others in not so high places. People have 
            referred to her "network of operatives". For a while she had quite 
            the reputation for the deviousness of her plotting. It was best not 
            to offend her; one could get burned. I remember once in the 
            mid-1980s when I was autocrating an event with a Hundred Years War 
            theme, I thought a riddle/quest activity might add to the enjoyment 
            of the day. Perhaps a bit of French/English espionage. Knowing 
            Menya's penchant for plotting, I asked her to set something up. 
            Menya accepted and kept me updated on the progress of the "plot". 
            She gave me a role to play on the day of the event. I was to listen 
            for a particular password and give a small scroll only to the person 
            who got it right. Meanwhile, Menya had been arranging the plot with 
            quite a number of her "operatives". The thing is, it was not a 
            French/English plot, but rather a plot to fool me into thinking that 
            there was an espionage game going on. She'd keep coralling different 
            people and sending them along to me with passwords that she made up 
            on the spot. The plan was that I was to get all excited about a game 
            that didn't exist (as everyone but me knew). She hadn't been happy, 
            you see, with being typecast as a plotter and I needed to be taught 
            a lesson. So learn my lesson and don't just see her as the imp she 
            was.<BR><BR>For a while there in the SCA, Menya and I hung around 
            the same group of friends, who met alot outside group meetings and 
            events. I got to see other sides of Menya. During our role playing 
            sessions, for example. I remember the science fiction game where 
            Menya played a Vargir character (a wolf-like species, of course) who 
            was one of our Pirate Quartet. Who could forget her character's 
            Donkey Kong addiction or fondness for howling operas - or the time 
            we hijacked an interstellar shipment of Glenfyddich only to find an 
            imperial plant.<BR><BR>Others have written about Menya's creative 
            side. She seemed adept at whatever art she turned her hand to, with 
            whatever tool. I remember her challenge to herself to learn the harp 
            to performance level within the space of a year - a challenge she 
            met (as most of you know; for most the picture that first comes to 
            mind of Menya is one with a harp). She was also adept at writing 
            words and music, calligraphy and illumination, enamelling, metalwork 
            and a host of other SCA skills. But I also remember her mastering 
            the mouse as a drawing tool, long before she got her tablet (and 
            master it she did; it was incredible the things she could draw with 
            it!). I saw (and heard) a lot of her creative side when I was 
            fortunate enough to share an apartment with her. <BR><BR>My chief 
            memories of her from that time, however, are the smaller things. I 
            will never be able to see dolmades (the Greek stuffed grape leaves) 
            without thinking of Menya. They were readily available in the market 
            down the street and Menya, enjoying them, liked to keep herself 
            stocked. Menya was not one to deny herself the small pleasures that 
            life can afford if the opportunity to avail herself of them 
            presented itself. It didn't suprise me at all to find that she had 
            ended up in a house with a jacuzzi.<BR><BR>This is getting pretty 
            long, and I've only just started to scratch the surface. I'll let 
            someone else have a chance to reveal another side of the 
            many-faceted Menya. For she surely was a 
    jewel.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR>

          <TD vAlign=top width="95%" colSpan=2>I was not that close to Menya, 
            just the odd dinner, or shakespear in the living room. I just wanted 
            to leave my anecdote as testament to her indelible touch.<BR><BR>I 
            was in hospital durring one of her radiation treatments, and she 
            would occasionaly drop by on her way home. My mother was having 
            difficulty with my illness (mental) and we were not really speaking. 
            One day my mother and I were sitting in the lounge, not speaking, 
            when Menya appeared. She bounced down the hallway in her winter coat 
            and a little cap, and sat in the chair in between us. I don't 
            remember all of what she said, but she drew my mother and I into a 
            conversation which lasted all of 20 minutes. After she left, my 
            mother and I kept talking. And we have continued to do so for 
            several years. <BR><BR>We have heard so much of Menya's "pranking", 
            but she also used her ability to sum up what was critial in a person 
            to smooth and facillitate where there was pain.<BR><BR>One way or 
            another, she will always be in my life. I will cry, but you will 
            still be there. Thank you.<BR><BR>annette</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR>

          <TD vAlign=top width="95%" colSpan=2>I think one of the more vivid 
            memories I have of Menya was her SCA "stupid peer trick." We were 
            all waiting around for a Laureling to happen (Balderic's, for those 
            of you in the SCA--I believe he was in the loo) so the Queen called 
            for a stupid peer trick. Rhiannon stepped up and proceeded to play 
            her harp--with a loaf of bread. It was extremely goofy, but it was 
            the deranged expression on her face that made it.<BR><BR>I also 
            remember that blue drink she mixed for me at my wedding shower (who 
            knows what was in there?) that led to bouts of dancing on the roof 
            and formerly sedate party attendees to start howling with laughter 
            at balloons placed in rude positions. <BR><BR>On the serious side, 
            she provided the music at my wedding, although I'll be danged if I 
            can remember any of it. I think I walked down the aisle to one of 
            the songs she wrote for Septentria.<BR><BR>To absent

          <TD vAlign=top width="95%" colSpan=2>&nbsp;One of the stories told 
            at at the memorial was the one about Menya's birthmark. She would 
            say, "I have a birthmark that you couldn't see if I was standing on 
            the beach in a string bikini", and then offer to show it to you for 
            $5.00 (more or less depending on how cute you were).<BR>&nbsp;What 
            I'm not sure about is whether she used this pick-up line on Pete 
            when they first met in person, nor whether Pete used his immortal 
            line: "Do you want to see my triple-fluted tongue 
            trick?"<BR>&nbsp;Either way, it was a match made, not in heaven, but

          <TD vAlign=top width="95%" colSpan=2>Susan Clark has reminded me -- 
            Menya made me a drink too, in a great tumbler, with an entire peeled 
            banana mashed across the top of it no less! 'Way more rum than coke, 
            if I recall correctly (surprised I remember it at all). It was 
            served with a fiendish grin.<BR><BR>I first met Menya in the Eaton 
            Centre of all places, in 1985. She was in the company of David 
            Tallan. I was in the company of Tarver. All of them made a deep 
            impression on my 21-year-old self -- I instantly knew that my 
            decision to join the SCA meant that I would meet the most 
            fascinating people in the world. I spent years making sure I could 
            sit near her and listen when she would play and sing.<BR><BR>Menya 
            played and danced during my wedding feast. I wish I had better 
            photos of that, not to mention a recording.<BR><BR>Many of you know 
            the story about how twelve of us, including Menya, were stuck in an 
            elevator during a New Year's Eve costume party. We had a Polaroid 
            camera and a good store of alcohol with us, so we managed to have a 
            memorable time despite our unfortunate circumstances. I gave one of 
            the snapshots to Pete and Menya -- it shows Menya dressed like an 
            angel (silvery halo included!), with the sweetest, most innocent 
            expression on her face. It would be fun to have on the Web 
            site.<BR><BR>Menya once wrote a song about a friend in the UK. I 
            loved the music, but I joked with her about how *utterly* 
            meaningless the lyrics were to those of us millions who hadn't met 
            this (no-doubt terrific) 'Mereddin' person. I wrote completely 
            different lyrics for our friend Vychata, and actually sang them out 
            loud (in front of other people) (yep) at a Pennsic one year. I can 
            still sing that song. I haven't heard a recording of the original. 
            Is there a chance that I possess the last clear memory of this 
            simple but effective melody? I hope not! There must be another 
            harp-playing friend who can still perform this song?<BR><BR>Menya 
            and I were almost exactly the same age. (I made the most of my two 
            weeks' seniority, that goes without saying.) Over the years, we 
            sometimes lived in the same building, even the same apartment, and 
            our acquaintance was constant except while she was in England. She 
            was very good to me when I was the one with cancer, and perhaps 
            because I have survived and she hasn't, I have a lingering feeling 
            that I didn't do enough to pay her back for that and all 
            else.<BR><BR>Thanks for everything, Menya.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR>

            Heaven and Hell party ("come as your favourite eclestiastical or 
            anti-eclesiastical figure or virtue or vice") - the elevator, being

            in her angel costume.<BR>&nbsp;We all knew - of course - that the 
            angel outfit was just her playing dress-up (shades of 
            'Alice-in-wonderland') and that she was really a [pun warning] 
            little devil at heart. But then she was always fond of playing 
            [major pun warning] the wolfe in sheep's clothing. You just knew

            Pete!<BR><BR>I remember that there were twelve people in the 
            elevator -- eight women and four men. The women sat on the floor of 
            the elevator, while the men stood around the walls. <BR><BR>I have a 
            second picture of the same scene (not including Menya). I'll see if 
            I can find it.<BR><BR>This was actually a "Dante" party. Chris 
            Kowalchuk was Dante, and David Tallan was Virgil, as I recall. Chris 
            played it up, dressing as a tourist with a camera and everything. 
            Gunnar was, er, he was . . . Jesus Christ. Yep, business card and 
            all.<BR><BR>As Gunnar says, we were on our way from Hell (on the 6th 
            floor) to Heaven (on a higher floor), where Menya and I were to be 
            married by the Borgia Pope. (He must have had a day pass or 
            something.) <BR><BR>Yes, it's true! I proposed, and she accepted. It 
            was to be a marriage made in heaven -- that went straight to 
            hell.<BR><BR>We spent our time in purgatory singing 1970s elevator 
            songs ("My name is Michael, I got a nickel" etc.) and conducting 
            poetry readings. <BR><BR>The people I can see here (forgive the 
            mixture of real/SCA names) are Hector, Madinia, Kim, Menya, and me. 
            Hector's big kilt is front and centre. Others I know were there 
            include Chris and David (maybe Tara?). The other picture shows more 
            people, I know.<BR><BR>After our hour in Purgatory, Menya and I 
            decided that perhaps our marriage was not in the cards. We called it 
            off, and next New Year's Eve I married Kim instead -- kazoo band and 
            all. Charles delivered his famous sermon on the subject of Esau and 
            Jacob, as I recall. Most satisfactory.<BR><BR>The weird thing is 
            that being stuck in an elevator is not anyone's idea of a good time. 
            However, many of those in the elevator, including Menya, told me in 
            later years that Purgatory was a memorable party-going highlight for 
            them -- and this in an era of fabulous 
  bashes.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR>

            brilliant piece of improvisation), and signed "B. Dunne". The class 
            then cracked up because Menya had given the name of the class 
            teacher who was sitting at his desk looking somewhat 
            surprised.<BR><BR>I'm sure I told this story many times to anyone 
            who would listen. When Menya could no longer speak, she still smiled 
            when I reminded her of it.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR>

            by author 02-12-2002 08:36 AM</SPAN> <BR>&nbsp;Hi All<BR>I was 
            fortunate enough to have been able to take part in Menya's care 
            team. This message board (Pete, you rock) has been a great help over 
            the last year. I don't think I've added anything though, so here 
            goes. I made this addition to the blue book last summer, and it's 
            about last Feb 13th, the day Menya died.<BR><BR>This is written 
            months later of the day that Menya died. When I stepped off the 
            elevator that evening to visit, the ward felt different. Ian met me 
            in the hall and asked if I would go into the quiet room with him for 
            a moment. I could see his news on his face, mingled with the 
            desperation to do the job of informing people right. I stood my 
            ground outside her room and asked him to just tell me what I already 
            knew. She had passed away barely 10 minutes before, that Pete was 
            with her right now, that he'd called her family and said Menya had 
            taken a turn but not how sharply because that's just not the sort of 
            thing you hear over the phone. I told him he'd done very well, that 
            the news had been perfectly delivered. <BR><BR>I stepped inside the 
            curtain drawn around her bed to see Pete kneeling beside her, 
            holding her hand, looking at her face. His eyes held a mixture of 
            relief, longing and love. In the coming hours many friends and 
            family came by. With the generous and competent care of one of the 
            nurses (and while once again listening to "Woodland Harp") I helped 
            to change Menya into some clothing picked out earlier in the week 
            for just that purpose; black skirt, burgundy batik top. Brushed 
            hair, new lip-gloss. Perfume. I left her with a silver chain with an 
            amber apple pendant - apples being the symbol of the Norse goddess 
            Idun, the eternal maiden - I felt that was somewhat appropriate. I 
            was amazed at the temperature changes in her body, at a newly added 
            weight, but most of all by the look of peace and total joy her face 
            had settled into. Seeing her then dressed in her own cloths was 
            extremely important. She looked the perfect and powerful queen. 
            There was a strong sense of clan around her, which I will always 
            feel privileged to have been a part of. The funeral home was called 
            and her father and brother waited with her to attend her out of the 
            building; Menya's body therefore skipped the standard trip to the 
            hospital morgue. As a devout non-conformist, I know this would have 
            pleased her. <BR><BR>Some felt her presence, others her absence, but 
            I think all felt the beginning of a hole in our lives that would be 
            made by Menya's death. How we fill that, I think, will be a 
            reflection of all she taught us and of our love for 
        her.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR>

          <TD vAlign=top width="95%" colSpan=2>THANK YOU FOR FOR SHARING THIS 
            STORY. I HAD A SISTER IN LAW THAT LOST HER LIFE FROM WHAT STARTING 
            OUT AS A BRIAN ANEURYSM. SHE WAS AT HOME ONE AFTERNOON WHEN SHE 
            ASKED HER DAUGHT TO CALL 911... SHE SAID SHE FELT LIKE SHE WAS 
            DYING. AND TO THINK SHE IS ONLY 29 YRS OLD. SHE MADE THE THE 
            HOSPTIAL. SHE HAD AN ANEURYSM THAT WAS BLEEDING IN HER BRAIN. OKAY 
            SHE HAD TO HAVE BRIAN SURGERY TO CLAP THE BLEED. YES, SHE SURVIVED 
            THE SURGERY! DOCTORS SAY SHE IS GOING TO BE OKAY. THE FAMILY CAN 
            EXHALE.. SHE WAS DOING SO GOOD, ALERT AS SHE COULD EVER BE. SHE KNEW 
            HER NAME, THE DATE, WHERE SHE WAS AT. SHE LOOKED LIKE SHE WAS 
            ALRIGHT. A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER WAS VALENTINE'S DAY 2002. THE FAMILY 
            WENT UP THERE IS SPEND VALENTINE'S DAY WITH. THEY WERE WITH HER ALL 
            NIGHT. THEY SAID SHE WAS DOING SO GOOD THAT SHE WILL BE ABLE TO DO 
            HOME THAT NEXT MONDAY. MEANWHILE HER SISTER AND I WENT OUT OF TOWN 
            FOR THE WEEKEND. SHE WAS DOING SO GOOD. MONDAY CAME SHE WENT HOME. 
            WE DIDN'T GO OVER THERE WE TIRED FROM DRIVING DURING OUR WEEKEND 
            VACTION. THE NEXT MORNING WE GET A CALL. SONIA FELL AND HIT HER HEAD 
            AND IS BACK IN THE HOSPITAL. SHE IS NOT DOING SO WELL. WE FIND OUT 
            THAT HER WAS CAUSED BY A STROKE FROM THE OTHER SIDE HER BRIAN. OKAY 
            WE CAN DEAL WITH SHE JUST HAVE TO HAVE THERAPY BUT SHE'LL BE OKAY. 
            THE NEXT DAY SHE IS REALLY SLEEPY WANTS TO SLEEP ALL TIME SHE IS 
            STILL TALKING. I THOUGHT WELL MAYBE IT'S JUST BEST FOR HER TO REST 
            SO HER BRIAN CAN HEAL. HOW IRONIC..... NEVER ONCE DID SHE SAY SHE 
            WAS SCARED, SHE NEVER SHOWED IT. SHE CONSTANTLY TOLD HER FAMILY SHE 
            LOVED THEM. SHE ALWAYS REACHED TO TOUCH WHEN YOU LEFT HER HOPSTIAL 
            ROOM. SHE CAN'T KEEP HER EYES OPEN. SHE TELLS EVERYONE SEVERAL TIMES 
            THAT SHE WANTED TO SEE HER DAUGHTER. THE PASTOR COMES TO PRAY FOR. 
            HER REPLY WAS THAT SHE IS GOING TO BE ALRIGHT. SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS 
            REALLY TIRED AND THE NURSES WOULD WAKE HER UP CHECKING ON HER EVERY 
            30 MINS. THE FAMILY WENT HOME. THATS THE LAST WE TALK TO HER. NOT 
            EVEN A GOOD HOUR AFTER WE LEFT SHE HAD ANOTHER STROKE, HER BRIAN 
            COULD HANDLE THE BLOOD THAT HER STRONG HEART WAS PUMPING. HER BRIAN 
            SHUT DOWN. THE ONLY THING THAT WAS KEEPING HER ALIVE WAS THE MACHINE 
            THAT WAS PULLED INTO THE WALL. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED. 
            SHE WAS JUST FEEL A FEW DAYS AGO. HER SISTER AND HER MOTHER DECIDED 
            TO TAKE HER OFF OF LIFE SUPPORT. SHE IS IN A PLACE WHERE SHE WON'T 
            EVER AGAIN. WE REALLY MISS HER. HER FURNERAL IS THIS 
        SATURDAY.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
