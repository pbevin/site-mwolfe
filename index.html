<h2>Obituary</h2>
<p>After a heroic, almost-five-year struggle with a rare breast cancer that spread 
  to the brain and involved numerous surgeries, chemotherapies and other treatments, 
  Menya Ruth Wolfe died in the Palliative Care Unit at St. Michael's Hospital 
  on February 13, 2001 at the age of 36, surrounded by love. She leaves behind 
  her remarkable husband, Pete Bevin, who shared the emotional roller coaster 
  ride of her last years; her parents Carla McKague and Morris Wolfe; her siblings 
  Jennifer and Benjamin; their partners Brad and Felice; and the nieces and nephews 
  she so treasured: Noah, Emma, Graeme, Hannah and Paul. Menya began to tell her 
  own story on her web site <a href="http://www.menyawolfe.com/wolf/">www.menyawolfe.com</a>. 
  As well, she and her husband established a help page for other women living 
  with inflammatory breast cancer: <a href="http://www.ibcsupport.org/">www.ibcsupport.org</a>. 
  Menya's family is enormously grateful to the team of friends, volunteers, homemakers, 
  nurses and doctors who lovingly cared for Menya at home for five months. A memorial 
  service will be held at Hart House at the University of Toronto on Sunday March 
  4, 2001 at 1&nbsp;p.m. In lieu of flowers, contributions in Menya's name can 
  be made to the organizations listed below. </p>
<h2>Donations</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.thh.on.ca/">Trinity Home Hospice</a> was a large part of 
  our life in Menya's last few months, and it would have been impossible to care 
  for her at home for so long without their unwavering support and care. Please 
  consider making a tax-free donation so that they can continue their work. Their 
  address is:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>Trinity Home Hospice

PO Box 324<br>Commerce Court Postal Station<br>Toronto ON M5L 1G3<br>Canada</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Menya also requested that donations be made to support research into Inflammatory 
  Breast Cancer. In Canada, please donate to the Saunders-Matthey Foundation for 
  Breast Cancer Research, 13 Partridge Drive, Kanata, Ontario K2M 2P6. In the 
  USA, the address is: Bunny Wing-Fernhall, Director, Development and Alumni Relations, 
  The George Washington University Medical Center, 2300 Eye Street, NW&nbsp;&nbsp;
